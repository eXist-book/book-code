                        <p>,<gloss target="#ART" rend="unmarked"> a word in its most extended and most popular
                sense meaning everything which we distinguish from Nature</gloss>. Art and Nature
              are the two most comprehensive genera of which the human mind has formed the
              conception. Under the genus Nature, or the genus Art, we include all the phenomena of
              the universe. But as our conception of Nature is indeterminate and variable, so in
              some degree is our conception of Art. Nor does such ambiguity arise only because some
              modes of thought refer a greater number of the phenomena of the universe to the genus
              Nature, and others a greater number to the genus Art. It arises also because we do not
              strictly limit the one genus by the other. The range of the phenomena to which we
              point, when we say Art, is never very exactly determined by the range of the other
              phenomena which at the same time we tacitly refer to the order of Nature. Everybody
              understands the general meaning of a phrase like <cit>
                                <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geoffrey_Chaucer">Chaucer's</name>

                            </cit>, or <cit>
                                <ref>

                            </cit>. In such phrases we intend to designate familiarly as Nature all which exists
              independently of our study, forethought and exertion—in other words, those phenomena
              in ourselves or the world which we do not originate but find; and we intend to
              designate familiarly as Art all which we do not find but originate—or, in other words,
              the phenomena which we add by study, forethought and exertion to those existing
              independently of us. But we do not use these designations consistently. Sometimes we
              draw an arbitrary line in the action of individuals and societies, and say, Here
              Nature ends and Art begins—such a law, such a practice, such an industry even, is
              natural, and such another is artificial; calling those natural which happen
              spontaneously and without much reflection, and the others artificial. But this line
              different observers draw at different places. Sometimes we adopt views which waive the
              distinction altogether. One such view is that wherein all phenomena are regarded as
              equally natural, and the idea of Nature is extended so as to include <quote>"all the
                powers existing in either the outer or the inner world, and everything which exists
                by means of those powers"</quote>. In this view Art becomes a part of Nature. It is
              illustrated in the familiar passage of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare">Shakespeare</name>, where
                <name type="person">Polixenes</name> reminds <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perdita_(The_Winter's_Tale)">Perdita</name>

                        <p>A posthumous essay of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">John Stuart Mill</name> contains
              a full philosophical exposition and defence of this mode of regarding the relations of
              Nature and Art. Defining Nature as above, and again as a <quote>"collective name for
                all facts, actual and possible"</quote>, that writer proceeds to say that such a
              definition <quote>"is evidently inapplicable to some of the modes in which the word is
                familiarly employed. For example, it entirely conflicts with the common form of
                speech by which Nature is opposed to Art, and natural to artificial. For in the
                sense of the word Nature which has thus been defined, and which is the true
                scientific sense, Art is as much Nature as anything else; and everything which is
                artificial is natural—Art has no independent powers of its own: Art is but the
                employment of the powers of Nature for an end. Phenomena produced by human agency,
                no less than those which, as far as we are concerned, are spontaneous, depend on the
                properties of the elementary forces, or of the elementary substances and their
                compounds. The united powers of the whole human race could not create a new property
                of matter in general, or of any one of its species. We can only take advantage for
                our purposes of the properties we find. A ship floats by the same laws of specific
                gravity and equilibrium as a tree uprooted by the wind and blown into the water. The
                corn which men raise for food grows and produces its grain by the same laws of
                vegetation by which the wild rose and the mountain strawberry bring forth their
                flowers and fruit. A house stands and holds together by the natural properties, the
                weight and cohesion of the materials which compose it. A steam engine works by the
                natural expansive force of steam, exerting a pressure upon one part of a system of
                arrangements, which pressure, by the mechanical properties of the lever, is
                transferred from that to another part, where it raises the weight or removes the
                obstacle brought into connexion with it. In these and all other artificial
                operations the office of man is, as has often been remarked, a very limited one; it
                consists of moving things into certain places. We move objects, and by doing this,
                bring some things into contact which were separate, or separate others which were in
                contact; and by this simple change of place, natural forces previously dormant are
                called into action, and produce the desired effect. Even the volition which designs,
                the intelligence which contrives, and the muscular force which executes these
                movements, are themselves powers of Nature"</quote>.</p>
                        <p>Another mode of thought, in some sort complementary to the last, is based on the
              analogy which the operations of forces external to a man bear to the operations of man
              himself. Study, forethought and exertion are assigned to Nature, and her operations
              are called operations of Art. This view was familiar to ancient systems of philosophy,
              and especially to that of the Stoics. According to the report of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, Nature as conceived by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeno_of_Citium">Zeno</name> was a
              fire, and at the same time a voluntary agent having the power or art of creating
              things with regularity and design (<quote>"naturam esse ignem artificiosum ad
                gignendum progredientem via"</quote>) . To this fire not merely creative force and
                <pb n="658" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0658.png"/> systematic action were
              ascribed, but actual personality. Nature was <quote>"non artificiosa solum, sed plane
                artifex"</quote>. <quote>"That which in the works of human art is done by hands, is
                done with much greater art by Nature, that is, by a fire which exercises an art and
                is the teacher of other arts"</quote>. This conception of Nature as an
              all-generating fire, and at the same time as a personal artist both teaching and
              including in her own activity all the human arts, on the one hand may be said, with
                <name type="person">Polixenes</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">J.S. Mill</name>, to merge Art in
              Nature ; but on the other hand it finds the essence of Nature in the resemblance of
              her operations to those of Art. <quote>"It is the <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi> of
                art,"</quote> according to the same system, <quote>"to create and beget,"</quote>
              and the reasoning proceeds —Nature creates and begets, therefore Nature is an artist
              or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demiurge">Demiurgus</name>. A
              kindred view is set forth by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Browne">Sir Thomas Browne</name> in the
                <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religio_Medici">
                                <hi rend="italic">Religio Medici</hi>
                            </title>, when he declares that <quote>"all things are artificial; for Nature is the
                Art of God"</quote>.</p>
                        <p>But these modes of thought, according to which, on the one hand, the processes of Art
              are included among processes of Nature, or on the other the processes of Nature among
              the processes of Art, are exceptional. In ordinary use the two conceptions, each of
              them somewhat vague and inexact, are antithetical. Their antithesis was what <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Johnson">Dr Johnson</name> had
              chiefly in his mind when he defined Art as <quote>"the power of doing something which
                is not taught by Nature or by instinct"</quote>. But this definition is
              insufficient, because the abstract word Art, whether used of all arts at once or of
              one at a time, is a name not only for the power of doing something, but for the
              exercise of the power; and not only for the exercise of the power, but for the rules
              according to which it is exercised; and not only for the rules, but for the result.
              Painting, for instance, is an art, and the word connotes not only the power to paint,
              but the act of painting; and not only the act, but the laws for performing the act
              rightly; and not only all these, but the-material consequences of the act or the thing
              painted. So of agriculture, navigation and the rest. Exception might also be taken to
                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Johnson">Dr
                Johnson's</name> definition on the ground that it excludes all actions of instinct
              from the genus Art, whereas usage has in more languages than one given the name of Art
              to several of those ingenuities in the lower animals which popular theory at the same
              time declares to be instinctive. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dante_Alighieri">Dante</name>, for instance, speaks
              of boughs shaken by the wind, but not so violently as to make the birds forgo their
              Art—</p>

                inventor among the race. Man, on the other hand, has an infinity of different arts

              invention, which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernard_le_Bovier_de_Fontenelle">Fontenelle</name>
              himself alleges in the ingenuities of man but not in those of the lower animals, are
              sufficient to make a generic difference, and to establish the impropriety of calling a
              honeycomb or a spider's web a work of Art. It is not our purpose to trespass on ground
              so debateable as that of the nature of consciousness in the lower animals. Enough that
              when we use the term Art of any action, it is because we are thinking of properties in
              the action from which we infer, whether justly or not, that the agent voluntarily and
              designedly puts forth skill for known ends and by regular and uniform methods. If,
              then, we were called upon to frame a general definition of Art, giving the word its
              widest and most comprehensive meaning, it would run thus :—<hi rend="italic">Every
                regulated operation or dexterity by which organized beings pursue ends which they
                know beforehand, together with the rules and the result of every such operation or
                dexterity</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Here it will be well to consider very briefly the natural history of the name which
              has been given to this very comprehensive conception by the principal branches of
              civilized mankind. Our own word Art the English language has taken, as all the Romance
              languages of modern Europe have taken theirs, directly from the Latin. The Latin <term xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">ars</hi>
                            </term>, according to the prevailing opinion of philologists, proceeds from a root AR,
              of which the primitive signification was to put or fit things together, and which is
              to be found in a large family of Greek words. The Greek <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέχυη</hi>
                            </term> the name both for arts in the particular and art in the abstract, is by its
              root related both to <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέκ-τωυ</hi>
                            </term> and <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέκ-υου</hi>
                            </term>, and thus contains the allied ideas of making and begetting. The <term xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi>
                            </term> of art in the logic of the Stoics, <quote>"to create and beget"</quote>, was
              strictly in accordance with this etymology. The Teutonic <term xml:lang="de">
                                <hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi>

              lost verb, of which we find the traces in <hi rend="italic">Kin-d</hi>, a child ; and
              the form <hi rend="italic">Ich kann</hi> thus meaning originally "I begot," contains
              the germ of the two several developments,—<hi rend="italic">können</hi>, "to be
              master," "to be able," and <hi rend="italic">kennen</hi>, "to know." We thus see that
              the chief Indo-European languages have with one consent extended a name for the most
              elementary exercise of a constructive or productive power, till that name has covered
              the whole range of the skilled and deliberate operations of sentient beings.</p>
                        <p>In proportion as men left out of sight the idea of creation, of constructing or
              producing, <q>"artificiosum esse ad gignendum"</q>, which is the primitive half of
              this extended notion, and attended only to the idea of skill, of proceeding by regular
              and disciplined methods, <q>"progredi via,"</q> which is the superadded half, the
              whole notion Art, and the name for it, might become subject to a process of thought
              which, if analysed, would be like this:— What is done by regular and disciplined
              methods is Art; facts are observed and classified, and a systematic view of the order
              of the universe obtained, by regular and disciplined methods; the observing and
              classifying of facts, and obtaining a systematic view of the order of the universe, is
              therefore Art. To a partial extent this did unconsciously take place. Science, of
              which the essence is only in knowledge and theory, came to be spoken of as Art, of
              which the essence is all in practice and production. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, notwithstanding his citation
              of the Stoical dictum that practice and production were of the essence of Art,
              elsewhere divides Art into two kinds—one by which things are only contemplated in the
              mind, another by which something is produced and done. (<cit>

                            </cit>) Of the former kind his instance is geometry; of the latter the art of playing
              on the lyre. Now geometry, understanding by geometry an acquisition of the mind, that
              is, a collected body of observations and deductions concerning the properties of space
              and magnitude, is a science and not an art; although there is an art of the geometer,
              which is the skill by which he solves any given problem in his science, and the rules
              of that skill, and his exertion in putting it forth. And so every science has its
              instrumental art or practical discipline; and in as far as the word Art is used only
              of the practical discipline or dexterity of the geometer, the astronomer, the
              logician, the grammarian, or other person whose business it is to collect and classify
              facts for contemplation, in so far the usage is just. The same justification may be
              extended to another usage, whereby in Latin, and some of its derivative languages, the
              name Art came to be transferred in a concrete sense to the body of rules, the written
              code or manual, which lays down the discipline and regulates the dexterity; as <hi rend="italic">ars grammatica, ars logica, ars rhetorica</hi> and the rest. But when
              the word is stretched so as to mean the sciences, as theoretical acquisitions of the
              mind, that meaning is illegitimate. Whether or not <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, in the passage above quoted,
              had in his mind the science of geometry as a collected body of observations and
              deductions, it is certain that the Ciceronian phrase of the <hi rend="italic">liberal
                arts</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">ingenuous arts</hi>, both in Latin and its
              derivatives or translations in modern speech, has been used currently to denote the
              sciences themselves, and not merely the disciplines instrumental to them. The <hi rend="italic">trivium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">quadrivium</hi> (grammar, logic
              and rhetoric—geometry, astronomy, music and arithmetic) have been habitually called
              arts, when some of them have been named in that sense in which they mean <pb n="659" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0659.png"/> not arts but sciences, <q>"only
                contemplating things in the mind."</q> Hence the nomenclature, history and practical
              organization, especially in Britain, of one great division of university studies: the
              division of <q>"arts,"</q> with its <q>"faculty,"</q> its examinations, and its
              degrees.</p>
                        <p>In the German language the words for Art and Science have in general been loosely
              interchanged. The etymology of the word for Art secured a long continuance for this
              ambiguity. <term xml:lang="de">
                                <hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi>
                            </term> was employed indiscriminately in both the senses of the primitive <hi rend="italic">Ich kann</hi>, to signify what I know, or Science, and what I can do,
              or Art. It was not till the end of the 17th century that a separate word for Science,
              the modern <term xml:lang="de">
                                <hi rend="italic">Wissenschaft</hi>
                            </term>, came into use. On the other hand, the Greek word <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέχυη</hi>
                            </term>, with its distinct suggestion of the root signification to make or get, acted
              probably as a safeguard against this tendency. The distinction between <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέχυη</hi>
                            </term>, Art or practice, and <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">έπιστήμη</hi>
                            </term>, knowledge or Science, is observed, though not systematically, in Greek
              philosophy. But for our present purpose, that of making clear the true relation
              between the one conception and the other, further quotation is rendered superfluous by
              the discussion the subject has received at the hands of the modern writer already
              quoted. Between Art, of which we practise the rules, and Science, of which we
              entertain the doctrines, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">J.S. Mill</name> establishes the
              difference in the simplest shape, by pointing out that one grammatical mood is proper
              for the conclusions of Science, and another for those of Art. Science enunciates her
              conclusions in the indicative mood, whereas <quote>"the imperative is the
                characteristic of Art, as distinguished from Science."</quote> And as Art utters her
              conclusions in her own form, so she supplies the substance of her own major premise.
                <quote>"Every art has one first principle, or general major premise, not borrowed
                from science, that which enunciates the object aimed at, and affirms it to be a
                desirable object. The builder's art assumes that it is desirable to have buildings;
                architecture (as one of the fine arts) that it is desirable to have them beautiful
                and imposing. The hygienic and medical arts assume, the one that the preservation of
                health, the other that the cure of disease, are fitting and desirable ends. These
                are not propositions of science. Propositions of science assert a matter of fact—an
                existence, a co-existence, a succession, or a resemblance. The propositions now
                spoken of do not assert that anything is, but enjoin or recommend that something
                should be. They are a class by themselves. A proposition of which the predicate is
                expressed by the words <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> or <hi rend="italic">should
                  be</hi> is generically different from one which is expressed by <hi rend="italic">is</hi> or <hi rend="italic">will be</hi>."</quote> And the logical relation of
              Art and Science, in other words, the manner of framing the intermediate member between
              the general major premise of Art and its imperative conclusion, is thus defined:— <cit>
                                <quote>"The Art [in any given case] proposes to itself an end to be attained,
                  defines the end, and hands it over to the Science. The Science receives it,
                  considers it as a phenomenon or effect to be studied, and having investigated its
                  causes and conditions, sends it back to Art with a theorem of the causes and
                  combinations by which it could be produced. Art then examines these combinations
                  of circumstances, and according as any of them are or are not in human power,
                  pronounces the end attainable or not. The only one of the premises, therefore,
                  which Art supplies, is the original major premise, which asserts that the
                  attainment of the given end is desirable. Science, then, lends to Art the
                  proposition (obtained by a series of inductions or deductions) that the
                  performance of certain actions will attain the end. From these premises Art
                  concludes that the performance of these actions is desirable, and finding it also
                  practicable, converts the theorem into a rule or precept. ... The grounds, then,
                  of every rule of Art are to be found in the theorems of Science. An Art, or a body
                  of Art, consists of the rules, together with as much of the speculative
                  propositions as comprises the justification of these rules. The complete Art of
                  any matter includes a selection of such a portion from the Science as is necessary
                  to show on what conditions the effects, which the Art aims at producing, depend.
                  And Art in general consists of the truths of Science arranged in the most
                  convenient order for practice, instead of the order which is most convenient for
                  thought. Science groups and arranges its truths so as to enable us to take in at
                  one view as much as possible of the general order of the universe. Art, though it
                  must assume the same general laws, follows them only into such of their detailed
                  consequences as have led to the formation of rules of conduct, and brings together
                  from parts of the field of Science most remote from one another, the truths
                  relating to the production of the different and heterogeneous causes necessary to
                  each effect which the exigencies of practical life require to be
                  produced."</quote>

                        <p>The whole discussion may be summed up thus. Science consists in knowing, Art consists
              in doing. What I must do in order to know, is Art subservient to Science: what I must
              know in order to do, is Science subservient to Art.</p>
                        <p>Art, then, is defined by two broad distinctions: first, its popular distinction from
              Nature; and next, its practical and theoretic distinction from Science. Both of these
              distinctions are observed in the terms of our definition given above. Within the
              proper limits of this definition, the conception of Art, and the use of the word for
              it, have undergone sundry variations. These variations correspond to certain
              vicissitudes or developments in the order of historical facts and in society. The
              requirements of society, stimulating the ingenuity of its individual members, have led
              to the invention of arts and groups of arts, constantly progressing, with the progress
              of civilization, in number, in complexity, and in resource. The religious imagination
              of early societies, who find themselves in possession of such an art or group of arts,
              forgets the history of the invention, and assigns it to the inspiration or special
              grace of some god or hero. So the Greeks assigned the arts of agriculture to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triptolemus">Triptolemus</name>,
              those of spinning and navigation to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ATHENA">Athena</name>, and of music to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo">Apollo</name>. At one stage
              of civilization one art or group of arts is held in higher esteem, another at another.
              In societies, like most of those of the ancient world, where slaves were employed in
              domestic service, and upon the handicrafts supplying the immediate utilities of
              life—food, shelter and clothing—these constituted a group of servile arts. The arts of
              husbandry or agriculture, on the other hand, have alternately been regarded as servile
              and as honourable according as their exercise has been in the hands of a subject
              class, as under feudal institutions, or, as under the Roman republic, of free
              cultivators. Under feudal institutions, or in a society in a state of permanent war,
              the allied arts of war and of government have been held the only honourable class. In
              commercial states, like the republics of Italy, the arts of gain, or of production
              (other than agricultural) and distribution, have made good their title to equal
              estimation and greater power beside the art of captains. But among peaceful arts,
              industries or trades, some have always been held to be of higher and others of lower
              rank; the higher rank being assigned to those that required larger operations, higher
              training, or more thoughtful conduct, and yielded ampler returns—the lower rank to
              those which called for simple manual exercise, especially if such exercise was of a
              disagreeable or degrading kind. In the cities of Italy, where both commerce and
              manufactures were for the first time organized on a considerable scale, the name <term xml:lang="it">
                                <hi rend="italic">arte</hi>
                            </term>, Art, was retained to designate the gilds or corporations by which the several
              industries were exercised; and, according to the nature of the industry, the art was
              classed as higher or lower (<term xml:lang="it">
                                <hi rend="italic">maggiore</hi>
                            </term> and <term xml:lang="it">

                            </term>).</p>
                        <p>The arts of which we have hitherto spoken have arisen from positive requirements, and
              supply what are strictly utilities, in societies; not excluding the art of war, at
              least so far as concerns one-half of war, the defensive half. But war continued to be
              an honourable pursuit, because it was a pursuit associated with birth, power and
              wealth, as well as with the virtue of courage, in cases where it had no longer the
              plea of utility, but was purely aggressive or predatory; and the arts of the chase
              have stood in this respect in an analogous position to those of war.</p>
                        <p>There are other arts which have not had their origin in positive practical needs, but
              have been practised from the first for pleasure or amusement. The most primitive human
              beings of whom we have any knowledge, the cave-dwellers of the palaeolithic period,
              had not only the useful art of chipping stones into spear-heads, knife-heads and
              arrow-heads, and making shafts or handles of these implements out of bone; they had
              also the ornamental art of scratching upon the bone handle the outlines of the animals
              they saw—mammoth, rhinoceros or reindeer—or of carving such a handle into a rude
              resemblance of one of these animals. Here we have a skill exercised, in the first
              case, for pure fancy or pleasure, and in the second, for adding an element of fancy or
              pleasure to an element of utility. Here, therefore, is the <pb n="660" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0660.png"/> germ of all those arts which produce
              imitations of natural objects for purposes of entertainment or delight, as painting,
              sculpture, and their subordinates; and of all those which fashion useful objects in
              one way rather than another because the one way gives pleasure and the other does not,
              as architecture and the subordinate decorative arts of furniture, pottery and the
              rest. Arts that work in a kindred way with different materials are those of dancing
              and music. Dancing works with the physical movements of human beings. Music works with
              sound. Between that imitative and plastic group, and the group of these which only
              produce motion or sound and pass away, there is the intermediate group of eloquence
              and the drama, which deal with the expression of human feeling in spoken words and
              acted gestures. There is also the comprehensive art of poetry, which works with the
              material of written words, and can ideally represent the whole material of human life
              and experience. Of all these arts the end is not use but pleasure, or pleasure before
              use, or at least pleasure and use conjointly. In modern language, there has grown up a
              usage which has put them into a class by themselves under the name of the Fine Arts,
              as distinguished from the Useful or Mechanical Arts. (See AESTHETICS and FINE ARTS.)
              Nay more, to them alone is often appropriated the use of the generic word Art, as if
              they and they only were the arts <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">κατ’έξοχήν</hi>
                            </term>. And further yet, custom has reduced the number which the class-word is meant
              to include. When Art and the works of Art are now currently spoken of in this sense,
              not even music or poetry is frequently denoted, but only architecture, sculpture and
              painting by themselves, or with their subordinate and decorative branches. In
              correspondence with this usage, another usage has removed from the class of <hi rend="italic">arts</hi>, and put into a contrasted class of <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi>, a large number of industries and their products, to which the
              generic term Art, according to our definition, properly applies. The definition covers
              the <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> arts, which can be efficiently exercised by mere
              trained habit, rote or calculation, just as well as the fine arts, which have to be
              exercised by a higher order of powers. But the word Art, becoming appropriated to the
              fine arts, has been treated as if it necessarily carried along with it, and as if
              works to be called works of art must necessarily possess, the attributes of free
              individual skill and invention, expressing themselves in ever new combinations of
              pleasurable contrivance, and seeking perfection not as a means towards some ulterior
              practical end but as an ideal end in itself.</p>

                        <p>, <gloss target="#ASIA" rend="unmarked">the name of one of the great continents into
                which the earth's surface is divided, embracing the north-eastern portion of the
                great mass of land which constitutes what is generally known as the Old World, of
                which Europe forms the northwestern and Africa the south-western region</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Much doubt attaches to the origin of the name. Some of the earliest Greek geographers
              divided their known world into two portions only, Europe and Asia, in which last <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Libya_(mythology)">Libya</name> (the
              Greek name for Africa) was included. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>, who ranks <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Libya_(mythology)">Libya</name> as one
              of the chief divisions of the world, separating it from Asia, repudiates as fables the
              ordinary explanations assigned to the names Europe and Asia, but confesses his
              inability to say whence they came. It would appear probable, however, that the former
              of these words was derived from an <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyrian</name> or <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrews">Hebrew</name> root, which signifies the
              west or setting sun, and the latter from a corresponding root meaning the east or
              rising sun, and that they were used at one time to imply the west and the east. There
              is ground also for supposing that they may at first have been used with a specific or
              restricted local application, a more extended signification having eventually been
              given to them. After the word Asia had acquired its larger sense, it was still
              specially used by the Greeks to designate the country around <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephesus">Ephesus</name>. The idea of Asia as
              originally formed was necessarily indefinite, and long continued to be so; and the
              area to which the name was finally applied, as geographical knowledge increased, was
              to a great extent determined by arbitrary and not very precise conceptions, rather
              than on the basis of natural relations and differences subsisting between it and the
              surrounding regions.</p>

                            <p> The northern boundary of Asia is formed by the Arctic Ocean; the coast-line falls
                between 700 and 75° N., and so lies within the Arctic circle, having its extreme
                northern point in Cape Sivero-Vostochnyi (i.e. north-east) or Chelyuskin, in 78° N.
                On the south the coast-line is far more irregular, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of
                Bengal, and the China Sea reaching about to the northern tropic at the mouths of the
                Indus, of the Ganges and of the Canton river; <pb n="735" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0735.png"/> while the great peninsulas of
                Arabia, Hindostan and Cambodia descend to about 10° N., and the Malay peninsula
                extends within a degree and a half of the equator. On the west the extreme point of
                Asia is found on the shore of the Mediterranean, at Cape Baba, in 260 E., not far
                from the Dardanelles. Thence the boundary passes in the one direction through the
                Mediterranean, and down the Red Sea to the southern point of Arabia, at the strait
                of Bab-el-Mandeb, in 450 E.; and in the other through the Black Sea, and along the
                range of Caucasus, following approximately 400 N. to the Caspian, whence it turns to
                the north on a line not far from the 60th meridian, along the Ural Mountains, and
                meets the Arctic Ocean nearly opposite the island of Novaya Zemlya. The most
                easterly point of Asia is East Cape (Vostochnyi, i.e. east, or Dezhnev), in 190° E.,
                at the entrance of Bering Strait. The boundary between this point and the extremity
                of the Malay Peninsula follows the coast of the Northern Pacific and the China Sea,
                on a line deeply broken by the projection of the peninsulas of Kamchatka and Korea,
                and the recession of the Sea of Okhotsk, the Yellow Sea, and the Gulfs of Tongking
                and Siam.</p>

                            <p>On the east and south-east of Asia are several important groups of islands, the
                more southern of which link this continent to Australia, and to the islands of the
                Pacific. The islands. Kurile islands, the Japanese group, Luchu, Formosa and the
                Philippines, may be regarded as unquestionable outliers of Asia. Between the islands
                of the Malay archipelago from Sumatra to New Guinea, and the neighbouring Asiatic
                continent, no definite relations appear ever to have existed, and no distinctly
                marked boundary for Asia has been established by the old geographers in this
                quarter. Modern science, however, has indicated a line of physical separation along
                the channel between Borneo and Celebes, called the Straits of Macassar, which
                follows approximately 120° E., to the west of which the flora and fauna are
                essentially Asiatic in their type, while to the south and east the Australian
                element begins to be distinctly marked, soon to become predominant. To this boundary
                has been given the name of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wallace_Line">Wallace's line</name>, after the
                eminent naturalist, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_Russel_Wallace">A.R. Wallace</name>, who
                first indicated its existence. </p>

                            <p>Owing to the great extent of Asia, it is not easy to obtain a correct conception of
                the actual form of its outline from ordinary maps, the distortions which accompany
                projections of Form of large spherical areas on a flat surface being necessarily
                great and misleading. Turning, therefore, to a globe, Asia viewed as a whole, will
                be seen to have the form of a great isosceles spherical triangle, having its
                north-eastern apex at East Cape (Vostochnyi), in Bering Strait; its two equal sides,
                in length about a quadrant of the sphere, or 6500 m., extending on the west to the
                southern point of Arabia, and on the east to the extremity of the Malay peninsula;
                and the base between these points occupying about 60° of a great circle, or 4500 m.,
                and being deeply indented by the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal on either side of
                the Indian peninsula. A great circle, drawn through East Cape and the southern point
                of Arabia, passes nearly along the coast-line of the Arctic Ocean, over the Ural
                Mountains, through the western part of the Caspian, and nearly along the boundary
                between Persia and Asiatic Turkey. Asia Minor and the north-western half of Arabia
                lie outside such a great circle, which otherwise indicates, with fair accuracy, the
                north-western boundary of Asia. In like manner a great circle drawn through East
                Cape and the extremity of the Malay peninsula, passes nearly over the coasts of
                Manchuria, China and Cochin-China, and departs comparatively little from the eastern
                boundary.</p>

                            <p>Asia is divided laterally along the parallel of 400 north by a depression which,
                beginning on the east of the desert of Gobi, extends westwards through Mongolia to
                Chinese Turkestan. To the west of Kashgar the central depression is limited by the
                meridional range of Sarikol and the great elevation of the Pamir, of which the
                Sarikol is the eastern face. The level of this depression (once a vast inland sea)
                between the mountains which enclose the sources of the Hwang-ho and the Sarikol
                range probably never exceeds 2000 ft. above sea, and modern researches tend to prove
                that in the central portions of the Gobi (about Lop Nor) it may be actually below
                sea-level. A vast proportion of the continent north of this central line is but a
                few hundred feet in altitude. Shelving gradually upward from the low flats of
                Siberia the general continental level rises to a great central waterparting, or
                divide, which stretches from the Black Sea through the Elburz and the Hindu Kush to
                the Tian-shan mountains in the Pamir region, and hence to Bering Strait on the
                extreme north-east. This great divide is not always marked by well-defined ranges
                facing steeply either to the north or south. There are considerable spaces where the
                strike, or axis, of the main ranges is transverse to the water-parting, which is
                then represented by intermediate highlands forming lacustrine regions with an
                indefinite watershed. Only a part of this great continental divide (including such
                ranges as the Hindu Kush, Tian-shan, Altai or Khangai) rises to any great height, a
                considerable portion of it being below 5000 ft. in altitude. South of the divide the
                level at once drops to the central depression of Gobi, which forms a vast interior,
                almost waterless space, where the local drainage is lost in deserts or swamps. South
                of this enclosed depression is another great hydrographic barrier which parts it
                from the low plains of the Amur, of China, Siam and India, bordered by the shallows
                of the Yellow Sea and the shoals which enclose the islands of Japan and Formosa, all
                of them once an integral part of the continent. This second barrier is one of the
                most mighty upheavals in the world, by reason both of its extent and its altitude.
                Starting from the Amur river and reaching along the eastern margin of the Gobi
                desert towards the sources of the Hwangho, it merges into the Altyn-tagh and the
                Kuen-lun, forming the northern face of the vast Tibetan highlands which are bounded
                on the south by the Himalaya. The Pamir highlands between the base of the Tian-shan
                mountains and the eastern buttresses of the Hindu Kush unite these two great
                divides, enclosing the Gobi depression on the west; and they would again be united
                on the east but for the transverse valley of the Amur, which parts the Khingan
                mountains from the Yablonoi system to the east of Lake Baikal.</p>
                            <p>If we consider the whole continent to be divided into three sections, viz. a
                northern section with an average altitude of less than 5000 ft. above sea, where all
                the main rivers flow northward to the Mediterranean, the Arctic Sea, or the Caspian;
                a central section of depression, where the drainage is lost in swamps or <hi rend="italic">hamūns</hi>, and of which the average level probably does not exceed
                2000 ft. above sea; and a southern section divided between highly elevated
                table-lands from 15,000 to 16,000 ft. in altitude, and lowlands of the Arabian,
                Indian, Siamese and Chinese peninsulas, with an ocean outlet for its drainage; we
                find that there is only one direct connexion between northern and southern sections
                which involves no mountain passes, and no formidable barrier of altitudes. That one
                is afforded by the narrow valley of the Hari Rud to the west of Herat. From the
                Caspian to Karachi it is possible to pass without encountering any orographic
                obstacle greater than the divide which separates the valley of the Hari Rud from the
                Helmund <hi rend="italic">hamūn</hi> basin, which may be represented by an altitude
                of about 4000 ft. above sea-level. This fact possesses great significance in
                connexion with the development of Asiatic railways.</p>

                            <p>The lakes of Asia are innumerable, and vary in size from an inland sea (such as
                Lakes Baikal and Balkash) to a highland loch, or the indefinitely extended swamps of
                Persia. Many of them are at high elevations (Lake Victoria, 13,400 ft., being
                probably the most elevated), and are undoubted vestiges of an ancient period of
                glaciation. Such lakes, as a rule, show indications of a gradual decrease in size,
                Others are relics of an earlier geological period, when land areas <pb n="736" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0736.png"/> recently upheaved from the sea were
                spread at low levels with alternate inundations of salt and fresh water. Of these
                Lop Nor and the Helmund <hi rend="italic">hamūns</hi> are typical. Such lakes (in
                common with all the plateau <hi rend="italic">hamūns</hi> of south-west Baluchistan
                and Persia) change their form and extent from season to season, and many of them are
                impregnated with saline deposits from the underlying strata. The <hi rend="italic">kavirs</hi>, or salt depressions, of the Persian desert are more frequently
                widespread deposits of mud and salt than water-covered areas.</p>

                            <p>Although for the purposes of geographical nomenclature, boundaries formed by a
                coast-line—that is, by depressions of the earth's solid crust <hi rend="italic">below</hi> the ocean level—are most easily recognized and are of special
                convenience; and although such boundaries, from following lines on which the
                continuity of the land is interrupted, often necessarily indicate important
                differences in the conditions of adjoining countries, and of their political and
                physical relations, yet variations of the elevation of the surface <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the sea-level frequently produce effects not less marked. The changes
                of temperature and climate caused by difference of elevation are quite comparable in
                their magnitude and effect on all organized creatures with those due to differences
                of latitude; and the relative position of the high and low lands on the earth's
                surface, by modifying the direction of the winds, the fall of rain, and other
                atmospheric phenomena, produce effects in no sense less important than those due to
                the relative distribution of the land and sea. Hence the study of the mountain
                ranges of a continent is, for a proper apprehension of its physical conditions and
                characteristics, as essential as the examination of its extent and position in
                relation to the equator and poles, and the configuration of its coasts.</p>

                            <p>From such causes the physical conditions of a large part of Asia, and the history
                of its population, have been very greatly influenced by the occurrence of the mass
                of mountain above described, which includes the Himalaya and the whole elevated area
                having true physical connexion with that range, and occupies an area about 2000 m.
                in length and varying from 100 to 500 m. in width, between 65º and 100° east and
                between 28° and 35º north. These mountains, which include the highest peaks in the
                world, rise, along their entire length, far above the line of perpetual snow, and
                few of the passes across the main ridges are at a less altitude than 15,000 or
                16,000 ft. above the sea. Peaks of 20,000 ft. abound along the whole chain, and the
                points that exceed that elevation are numerous. A mountain range such as this,
                attaining altitudes at which vegetable life ceases, and the support of animal life
                is extremely difficult, constitutes an almost impassable barrier against the spread
                of all forms of living creatures. The mountain mass, moreover, is not less important
                in causing a complete separation between the atmospheric conditions on its opposite
                flanks, by reason of the extent to which it penetrates that stratum of the
                atmosphere which is in contact with the earth's surface and is effective in
                determining climate. The highest summits create serious obstructions to the
                movements of nearly three-fourths of the mass of the air resting on this part of the
                earth, and of nearly the whole of the moisture it contains ; the average height of
                the entire chain is such as to make it an almost absolute barrier to one-half of the
                air and three-fourths of the moisture; while the lower ranges also produce important
                atmospheric effects, one-fourth of the air and one-half of the watery vapour it
                carries with it lying below 9000 ft.</p>
                            <p>This great mass of mountain, constituting as it does a complete natural line of
                division across a large part of the continent, will form a convenient basis from
                which to work, in proceeding, as will now be done, to give a general view of the
                principal countries contained in Asia.</p>

                            <p>The summit of the great mountain mass is occupied by Tibet, a country known by its
                inhabitants under the name of <hi rend="italic">Bod</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bodyul</hi>. Tibet is a rugged table-land, narrow as compared with its length,
                broken up by a succession of mountain ranges, which follow as a rule the direction
                of the length of the table-land, and commonly rise into the regions of perpetual
                snow ; between the flanks of these lie valleys, closely hemmed in, usually narrow,
                having a very moderate inclination, but at intervals opening out into wide plains,
                and occupied either by rivers, or frequently by lakes from which there is no outflow
                and the waters of which are salt. The eastern termination of Tibet is in the line of
                snowy mountains which flanks China on the west, between the 27th and 35th parallels
                of latitude, and about 103º east. On the west the table-land is prolonged beyond the
                political limits of Tibet, though with much the same physical features, to about 70°
                east, beyond which it terminates; and the ranges which are covered with perpetual
                snow as far west as Samarkand, thence rapidly diminish in height, and terminate in
                low hills north of Bokhara.</p>
                            <p>The mean elevation of Tibet may be taken as 15,000 ft. above the sea. The broad
                mountainous slope by which it is connected with the lower levels of Hindustan
                contains the ranges known as the Himalaya ; the name Kuen-lun is generally applied
                to the northern slope that descends to the central plains of the Gobi, though these
                mountains are not locally known under those names, Kuen-lun being apparently a
                Chinese designation.</p>
                            <p>The extreme rigour of the climate of Tibet, which combines great cold with great
                drought, makes the country essentially very poor, and the chief portion of it little
                better than desert. The vegetation is everywhere most scanty, and scarcely anything
                deserving the name of a tree is to be found unless in the more sheltered spots, and
                then artificially planted. The population in the lower and warmer valleys live in
                houses, and follow agriculture ; in the higher regions they are nomadic shepherds,
                thinly scattered over a large area.</p>

                country, though generally broken up with mountains of moderate elevation, possesses
                none of very great importance apart from those of its western border. It is well
                watered, populous, and, as a rule, highly cultivated, fertile, and well wooded ; the
                climate is analogous to that of southern Europe, with hot summers, and winters
                everywhere cold and in the north decidedly severe.</p>

                meridians, high ranges extend from about 35º N. in a southerly direction, which,
                spreading outwards as they go south, reach the sea at various points in Cochin-
                China, the Malay peninsula, and the east flank of Bengal. Between these ranges,
                which are probably permanently snowy to about 27° N., flow the great rivers of the
                Indo-Chinese peninsula, the Mekong, the Menam, the Salween, and the Irrawaddy, the
                valleys of which form the main portions of the states of Cochin- China (including
                Tongking and Cambodia), of Siam (including Laos) and of Burma. The people of
                Cochin-China are called Anam ; it is probably from a corruption of their name for
                the capital of Tongking, Kechao, that the Portuguese Cochin has been derived. All
                these countries are well watered, populous and fertile, with a climate very similar
                to that of eastern Bengal. The geography of the region in which the mountains of
                Cochin-China and Siam join Tibet is still imperfectly known, but there is no ground
                left for doubting that the great river of eastern Tibet, the Tsanpo, supplies the
                main stream of the Brahmaputra. The two great rivers of China, the Hwang-ho and the
                Yang-tsze-kiang, take their rise from the eastern face of Tibet, the former from the
                north-east angle, the latter from the south-east. The main stream of this last is
                called Dichu in Tibet, and its chief feeder is the Ya-lung-kiang, which rises not
                far from the Hwang-ho, and is considered the territorial boundary between China and
                Tibet.</p>

                where the highest points rise to over 8000 ft., though the ordinary altitude of the
                higher hills hardly exceeds 4000 ft. : the general level of the table-land lies

                which rises at its highest point to about 1000 ft., and includes altogether, with
                its prolongation up the valley of Assam, an area of about 500.000 sq. m., comprising
                the richest, the most populous and most civilized districts of India. The great
                plain extends, with an almost unbroken surface, from the most western to the most
                eastern extremity of British India, and is composed of deposits so finely
                comminuted, that it is no exaggeration to say that it is possible to go from the Bay
                of Bengal up the Ganges, through the Punjab, and down the Indus again to the sea,

                Himalaya in the regions of central Tibet.</p>
                            <p>The population of India is very large, some of its districts being among the most
                densely peopled in the world. The country is generally well cleared, and forests
                are, as a rule, found only along the flanks of the mountains, where the fall of rain
                is most abundant. The more open parts are highly cultivated, and large cities
                abound. The climate is generally such as to secure the population the necessaries of
                life without severe labour; the extremes of heat and drought are such as to render

                            <p>The island of Ceylon is distinguished from the neighbouring parts of British India
                by little more than its separate administration and the Buddhistic religion of its
                population. The highest point in Ceylon rises to about 9000 ft. above the sea, and
                the mountain slopes are densely covered with forest. The lower levels are in climate
                and cultivation quite similar to the regions in the same latitude on the Malay

                the south-western extremity of Burma. They possibly owe their existence to the

                            <p>The portion of Asia west of British India, excluding Arabia and Syria, forms
                another extensive plateau covering an area as large as that of Tibet, though at a
                much lower altitude. Its southern border runs along the Arabian Sea, the Persian
                Gulf, the Tigris, and thence westward to the north-east angle of the Levant; on the
                north the high land follows nearly 36º N. to the southern shore of the Caspian, and
                thence to the Black Sea and Sea of Marmora. Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Iran or
                Persia, Armenia and the provinces of Asia Minor occupy this high region, with which
                they are nearly conterminous. The eastern flank of this tableland follows a line of
                hills drawn a short distance from the Indus, between the mouth of that river and the
                Himalaya, about on the 72nd meridian; these hills do not generally exceed 4000 or
                5000 ft. in elevation, but a few of the summits reach 10,000 ft. or more. The
                southern and south-western face follows the coast closely up the Persian Gulf from
                the mouth of the Indus, and is formed farther west by the mountain scarp, which,
                rising in many points to 10,000 ft., flanks the Tigris and the Mesopotamian plains,
                and extends along Kurdistan and Armenia nearly to the 40th meridian ; beyond which
                it turns along the Taurus range, and the north - eastern angle of the Mediterranean.
                The north - eastern portion of the Afghan tableland abuts on the Himalaya and Tibet,
                with which it forms a continuous mass of mountain between the 71st and 72nd
                meridians, and 34° and 36º N. From the point of intersection of the 71st meridian
                with the 36th parallel of latitude, an unbroken range of mountain stretches on one
                side towards the north-east, up to the crest of the northern slope of the Tibetan
                plateau, and on the other nearly due west as far as the Caspian. The north-eastern
                portion of this range is of great altitude, and separates the headwaters of the
                Oxus, which run off to the Aral Sea, from those of the Indus and its Kabul
                tributary, which, uniting below Peshawar, are thence discharged southward into the
                Arabian Sea. The western part of the range, which received the name of Paropamisus
                Mons from the ancients, diminishes in height west of the 65th meridian and
                constitutes the northern face of the Afghan and Persian plateau, rising abruptly
                from the plains of the Turkoman desert, which lies between the Oxus and the Caspian.
                These mountains at some points attain a height of 10,000 or 12,000 ft. Along the
                south coast of the Caspian this line of elevation is prolonged as the Elburz range
                (not to be confused with t h e Elburz of the Caucasus), and has its culminating
                point in Demavend, which rises to 19,400 ft. above the sea ; thence it extends to
                the north-west to Ararat, which rises to upwards of 17,000 ft., from the vicinity of
                which the Euphrates flows off to the south-west, across the high lands of Armenia.
                Below the north-east declivity of this range lies Georgia, on the other side of
                which province rises the Caucasus, the boundary of Asia and Europe between the
                Caspian and Black Seas, the highest points of which reach an elevation of nearly
                19,000 ft. West of Ararat high hills extend along the Black Sea, between which and
                the Taurus range lies the plateau of Asia Minor, reaching to the Aegean Sea ; the
                mountains along the Black Sea, on which are the Olympus and Ida of the ancients,
                rise to 6000 or 7000 ft. ; the Taurus is more lofty, reaching 8000 and 10,000 ft. ;
                both ranges decline in altitude as they approach the Mediterranean.</p>
                            <p>This great plateau, extending from the Mediterranean to the Indus, has a length of
                about 2500 m. from east to west, and a breadth of upwards of 600 m. on the west and
                nowhere of less than 250 m. It lies generally at altitudes between 2000 ft. and 8000
                ft. above the sea-level. Viewed as a whole, the eastern half of this region,
                comprising Persia, Afghanistan and Baluchistan, is poor and unproductive. The
                climate is very severe in the winter and extremely hot in summer. The rainfall is
                very scanty, and running waters are hardly known, excepting among the mountains
                which form the scarps of the elevated country. The population is sparse, frequently
                nomadic and addicted to plunder ; progress in the arts and habits of civilization is
                small. The western part of the area falls within <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Turkish empire</name>. Its
                climate is less hot and arid, its natural productiveness much greater, and its
                population more settled and on the whole more advanced.</p>

                            <p>The peninsula of Arabia, with Syria, its continuation to the northwest has some of
                the characteristics of the hottest and driest parts of Persia and Baluchistan.
                Excepting the northern part of this tract, which is conterminous with the plain of
                Mesopotamia (which at its highest point reaches an elevation of about 700 ft. above
                the sea), the country is covered with low mountains, rising to 3000 or 4000 ft. in
                altitude, having among them narrow valleys in which the vegetation is scanty, with
                exceptional regions of greater fertility in the neighbourhood of the coasts, where
                the rainfall is greatest. In northern Syria the mountains of Lebanon rise to about
                10,000 ft., and with a more copious water supply the country becomes more
                productive. The whole tract, excepting south-eastern Arabia, is nominally subject to
                Turkey, but the people are to no small extent practically independent, living a
                nomadic, pastoral and freebooting life under petty chiefs, in the more arid
                districts, but settled in towns in the more fertile tracts, where agriculture
                becomes more profitable and external commerce is established.</p>

                Aral Seas is a nearly desert low-lying plain, extending to the foot of the
                north-western extremity of the great Tibeto-Himalayan mountains, and prolonged
                eastward up the valleys of the Oxus (Amu-Darya) and Jaxartes (Syr-Darya), and
                northward across the country of the Kirghiz to the south-western border of Siberia.
                It includes Bokhara, Khiva and Turkestan proper, in which the Uzbeg Turks are
                dominant, and for the most part is inhabited by nomadic tribes, who are marauders,
                enjoying the reputation of being the worst among a race of professed robbers. The
                tribes to the north, subject to Russia, are naturally more peaceable, and have been
                brought into some degree of discipline. In this tract the rainfall is nowhere
                sufficient for the purposes of agriculture, which is only possible by help of
                irrigation ; and the fixed population (which contains a non-Turkish element) is
                comparatively small, and restricted to the towns and the districts near the
                rivers.</p>
                            <p>The north-western extremity of the elevated Tibeto-Himalayan mountain plateau is
                situated about on 73° E. and 39° N. This region is known as Pamir; it has all the
                characteristics of the highest regions of Tibet, and so far fitly receives the
                Russian designation of <foreign xml:lang="ru">steppe</foreign>; but it seems to have
                no special peculiarities, and the reason of its having been so long regarded as a
                geographical enigma is not obvious. From it the Oxus, or Amu, flows off to the west,
                and the Jaxartes, or Syr, to the north, through <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khanate_of_Kokand">the Turki state of

                plateau that traverse the principalities of Yarkand and Khotan, which are also
                Turki. Here the Tibetan mountains unite with the line of elevation which stretches

                            <p>A range of mountains, called Stanovoi, rising to heights of 4000 or 5000 ft.,
                follows the southern coast of the eastern extremity of Asia from Kamchatka to the
                borders of Manchuria, as far as the 135th meridian, in lat. 55º N. Thence the
                Yablonoi range, continuing in the same direction, divides the waters of the river
                Lena, which flows through Siberia into the Arctic Sea, from those of the river Amur,
                which falls into the North Pacific ; the basin of this river, with its affluents,

                southward to the Chinese frontier near Peking, east of which the drainage falls into
                the Amur and the Yellow Sea, while to the west is an almost rainless region, the

                            <p>From the western end of the Yablonoi range, on the 115th meridian, a mountainous
                belt extends along a somewhat irregular line to the extremity of Pamir, known under
                various names in its different parts, and broken up into several branches, enclosing
                among them many isolated drainage areas, from which there is no outflow, and within
                which numerous lakes are formed. The most important of these ranges is the Tian-shan
                or Celestial Mountains, which form the northern boundary of the Gobi desert; they
                lie between 40° and 43° N., and between 75º and 95º E., and some of the summits are
                said to exceed 20,000 ft. in altitude ; along the foot of this range are the
                principal cultivated districts of central Asia, and here too are situated the few
                towns which have sprung up in this barren and thinly peopled region. Next may be
                named the Ala-tau, on the prolongation of the Tian-shan, flanking the Syr on the
                north, and rising to 14,000 or 15,000 ft. It forms the barrier between the Issyk-kul
                and Balkash lakes, the elevation of which is about 5000 ft. Last is the Altai, near
                the 50th parallel, rising to 10,000 or 12,000 ft., which separates the waters of the
                great rivers of western Siberia from those that collect into the lakes of northwest
                Mongolia, Dzungaria and Kalka. A line of elevation is continued west of the Altai to
                the Ural Mountains, not rising to considerable altitudes; this divides the drainage
                of south-west Siberia from the great plains lying north-east of the Aral Sea.</p>
                            <p>The central area bounded on the north and north-west by the Yablonoi Mountains and
                their western extension in the Tian-shan, on the south by the northern face of the
                Tibetan plateau, and on the east by the Khingan range before alluded to, forms the
                great desert of central Asia, known as the Gobi. Its eastern part is nearly
                conterminous with south Mongolia, its western forms Chinese or eastern Turkestan. It
                appears likely that no part of this great central Asiatic desert is less than 2000
                ft. above the sea-level. The elevation of the plain about Kashgar and Yarkand is
                from 4000 to 6000 ft. The more northern parts of Mongolia are between 4000 and 6000
                ft., and no portion of the route across the desert between the Chinese frontier and
                Kiakhta is below 3000 ft. The precise positions of the mountain ridges that traverse
                this central area are not properly known ; their elevation is everywhere
                considerable, and many points are known to exceed 10,000 or 12,000 ft.</p>
                            <p>In Mongolia the population is essentially nomadic, its wealth consisting in herds
                of horned cattle, sheep, horses and camels. The Turki tribes, occupying western
                Mongolia, are among the least civilized of human beings, and it is chiefly to their
                extreme barbarity and cruelty that our ignorance of central Asia is due. The climate
                is very severe, with great extremes of heat and cold. The drought is very great;
                rain falls rarely and in small quantities. The surface is for the most part a hard
                stony desert, areas of blown sand occurring but exceptionally. There are few towns
                or settled villages, except <pb n="738" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0738.png"/> along the slopes of the higher mountains, on which the rain falls more
                abundantly, or the melting snow supplies streams for irrigation. It is only in such
                situations that cultivated lands are found, and beyond them trees are hardly to be
                seen.</p>

                            <p>The portion of Asia which lies between the Arctic Ocean and the mountainous belt
                bounding Manchuria, Mongolia and Turkestan on the north is Siberia. It includes an
                immense high and broken plateau which spreads from south-west to north-east, losing
                in width and altitude as it advances north-east. It is fringed on either side by
                high border ridges, which subside on the north-west into a stretch of high plains,
                1500 to 2000 ft. high, finally dropping to lowlands a few hundred feet above
                sea-level. The extremes of heat and cold are very great. The rainfall, though not
                heavy, is sufficient to maintain such vegetation as is compatible with the
                conditions of temperature, and the surface is often swampy or peaty. The
                mountain-sides are commonly clothed with pine forests, and the plains with grasses
                or shrubs. The population is very scanty ; the cultivated tracts are comparatively
                small in extent and restricted to the more settled districts. The towns are entirely
                Russian. The indigenous races are nomadic Mongols, of a peaceful character, but in a
                very backward state of civilization. The Ural Mountains do not exceed 2000 or 3000
                ft. in average altitude, the highest summits not exceeding 6000 ft., and one of the
                passes being as low as 3400 ft. In the southern half of the range are the chief
                mining districts of Russia. The Ob, Yenisei and Lena, which traverse Siberia, are
                among the largest rivers in the world.</p>

                            <p>The southern group of the Malay Archipelago, from Sumatra to Java and Timor,
                extends in the arc of a circle between 95º and 127º E., and from 5° to 10° S. The
                central part of the group is a volcanic region, many of the volcanoes being still
                active, the summits frequently rising to 10,000 ft. or more.</p>
                            <p>Sumatra, the largest of the islands, is but thinly peopled ; the greater part of
                the surface is covered with dense forest, the cultivated area being comparatively
                small, confined to the low lands, and chiefly in the volcanic region near the centre
                of the island. Java is the most thickly peopled, best cultivated and most advanced
                island of the whole Eastern archipelago. It has attained a high degree of wealth and
                prosperity under the Dutch government. The people are peaceful and industrious, and
                chiefly occupied with agriculture. The highest of the volcanic peaks rises to 12,000
                ft. above the sea. The eastern islands of this group are less productive and less
                advanced.</p>
                            <p>Borneo, the most western and the largest of the northern group of islands which
                extends between 110° and 150° E., as far as New Guinea or Papua, is but little
                known. The population is small, rude and uncivilized ; and the surface is rough and
                mountainous and generally covered with forest except near the coast, to the alluvial
                lands on which settlers have been attracted from various surrounding countries. The
                highest mountain rises to nearly 14,000 ft., but the ordinary elevations do not
                exceed 4000 or 5000 ft.</p>
                            <p>Of Celebes less is known than of Borneo, which it resembles in condition and
                natural characteristics. The highest known peaks rise to 8000 ft., some of them
                being volcanic.</p>

                            <p>Guinea extends almost to the same meridian as the eastern coast of Australia, from
                the north point of which it is separated by Torres Straits. Very little is known of
                the interior. The mountains are said to rise to 20,000 ft., having the appearance of
                being permanently covered with snow ; the surface seems generally to be clothed with
                thick wood. The inhabitants are of the Negrito type, with curly or crisp and bushy
                hair ; those of the west coast have come more into communication with the traders of
                other islands and are fairly civilized. Eastward, many of the tribes are barbarous
                savages.</p>
                            <p>The Philippine Islands lie between 5° and 20º N., between Borneo and southern
                China. The highest land does not rise to a greater height than 10,250 ft. ; the
                climate is well suited for agriculture, and the islands generally are fertile and
                fairly cultivated, though not coming up to the standard of Java either in wealth or
                population.</p>
                            <p>Formosa, which is situated under the northern tropic, near the coast of China, is
                traversed by a high range of mountains, reaching nearly 13,000 ft. in elevation. On
                its western side, which is occupied by an immigrant Chinese population, are open and
                well-cultivated plains ; on the east it is mountainous, and occupied by independent
                indigenous tribes in a less advanced state.</p>
                            <p>The islands of Japan, not including Sakhalin, of which half is Japanese, lie
                between the 30th and 45th parallels. The whole group is traversed by a line of
                volcanic mountains, some of which are in activity, the highest point being about
                13,000 ft. above the sea. The country is generally well watered, fertile and well
                cultivated. The Japanese people have added to their ancient civilization and their
                remarkable artistic faculty, an adaptation of Western methods, and a capacity for
                progress in war and commerce, which single them out among Eastern races as a great
                modern world-force.</p>

                                <p>The progress of geodetic surveys in Russia had long ago extended across the
                  European half of the great empire, St Petersburg being connected with Tiflis on
                  the southern slopes of the Caucasus by a direct system of triangulation carried
                  out with the highest scientific precision. St Petersburg, again, is connected with
                  Greenwich by European systems of triangulation; and the Greenwich meridian is
                  adopted by Russia as the zero for all her longitude values. But beyond the eastern
                  shores of the Caspian no system of direct geodetic measurement by first-class
                  triangulation has been possible, and the surveys of Asiatic Russia are separated
                  from those of Europe by the width of that inland sea. The arid nature of the
                  trans-Caspian deserts has proved an insuperable obstacle to those rigorous methods
                  of geodetic survey which distinguish Russian methods in Europe, so that Russian
                  geography in central Asia is dependent on other means than that of direct
                  measurement for the co-ordinate values in latitude and longitude for any given
                  point. The astronomical observatory at Tashkent is adopted for the initial
                  starting-point of the trans-Caspian triangulation of Russia ; the triangulation
                  ranks as second-class only, and now extends to the Pamir frontier beyond Osh. The
                  longitude of the Tashkent observatory has been determined by telegraph
                  differentially with Pulkova as follows :— <table rows="4" cols="4">

                                <p>Exact surveys in Russia, based upon triangulation, extend as far east as Chinese
                  Turkestan in longitude about 75° E. of Greenwich. In India geodetic triangulation
                  furnishes the basis for exact surveys as far east as the eastern boundaries of
                  Burma in longitude about 100° E.</p>
                                <p>The close of the 19th century witnessed the forging of the final links in the
                  great geodetic triangulation of India, so far as the peninsula is concerned.
                  Further geodetic connexion with the European systems remains to be accomplished.
                  Since 1890 further and more rigorous application of the telegraphic method of
                  determining longitudes differentially with Greenwich has resulted in a slight
                  correction (amounting to about 2" of arc) to the previous determination by the
                  same method through Suez. This last determination was effected through four arcs
                  as follows :— <list>
                                        <item>I. Greenwich—Potsdam.</item>
                                        <item>II. Potsdam—Teheran.</item>

                                        <item>IV. Bushire—Karachi.</item>
                                    </list> Each arc was measured with every precaution and a multitude of
                  observations. The only element of uncertainty was caused by the retardation of the
                  current, which between Potsdam and Teheran (3000 m.) took 08-20 to travel; but it
                  is probable that the final value can be accepted as correct to within 08-05.</p>
                                <p>The final result of this latest determination is to place the Madras observatory
                  2' 27" to the west of the position adopted for it on the strength of absolute
                  astronomical determinations.</p>

                  Indian surveys which sufficiently proves that the deductive methods employed by
                  both countries for the determination of the co-ordinate values of fixed points so
                  far agree that, for all practical purposes of future Asiatic cartography, no
                  difficulty in adjustment between Indian and Russian mapping need be

                  systems involving more or less irregularity have been pushed outwards on all
                  sides. They reach through Afghanistan and Baluchistan to the eastern districts of
                  Persia, and along the coast of Makran to that of Arabia. They have long ago
                  included the farther mountain peaks of Nepal, and they now branch outwards towards
                  western China and into Siam. These far extensions furnish the basis for a vast
                  amount of exploratory survey of a strictly geographical character, and they have
                  contributed largely towards raising the standard of accuracy in Asiatic
                  geographical surveys to a level which was deemed unattainable fifty years ago.
                  There is yet a vast field open in Asia for this class of surveys. While at the
                  close of the 19th century western Asia (exclusive of Arabia) may be said to have
                  been freed from all geographical perplexity, China, Mongolia and eastern Siberia
                  still include enormous areas of which geographical knowledge is in a primitive
                  stage of nebulous uncertainty.</p>

                  surveys) the modern period has been so prolific that it is only possible to refer
                  in barest outline to some of the principal expeditions, most of which have been
                  directed either to the great elevated tableland of Tibet or to the central
                  depression which exists to the north of it. In southern Tibet the trans-Himalayan
                  explorations of the native surveyors attached to the Indian survey, notably
                  Pundits <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nain_Singh_Rawat">Nain Singh</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Krishna_Singh">Krishna</name>, added largely to
                  our knowledge of the great plateau. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nain_Singh_Rawat">Nain Singh</name> explored
                  the sources of the Indus and of the Upper Brahmaputra in the years 1865-1867 ; and
                  in 1874-1875 he followed a line from the eastern frontiers of Kashmir to the
                  Tengri Nor lake and thence to Lhasa, in which city he remained for some months.
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Krishna_Singh">Krishna</name>'s remarkable journey in 1879-1882 extended from Lhasa northwards

                  Sachu, or Saitu, in Mongolia. He subsequently passed through eastern Tibet to the
                  town of Darchendo, or Tachienlu, on the high road between Lhasa and Peking, and on
                  the borders of China. Failing to reach India through Upper Assam he returned to
                  the neighbourhood of Lhasa, and crossed the Himalayas by a more westerly route.
                  Both these explorers visited Lhasa.</p>

                                <p>In 1871-1873 the great Russian explorer, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolai_Przhevalsky">Nicolai Prjevalsky</name>,
                  crossed the Gobi desert from the north to Kansu in western China. He first defined
                  the geography of Tsaidam, and mapped the hydrography of that remarkable region,
                  from which emanate the great rivers of China, Siam and Burma. He penetrated
                  southwards to within a month's march of Lhasa. In 1876 he visited the Lop Nor and
                  discovered the Altyn Tagh range. In 1879 he followed up the Urangi river to the
                  Altai Mountains, and demonstrated to the world the extraordinary physical changes
                  which have passed over the heart of the Asiatic continent since <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genghis_Khan">Jenghiz Khan</name>
                  massed his vast armies in those provinces. He crossed, and named, the Dzungarian
                  extension of the Gobi desert, and then traversed the Gobi itself from Hami to
                  Sachu, which became a point of junction between his journeys and those of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Krishna_Singh">Krishna</name>. He
                  visited the sources of the Hwang-ho (Yellow river) and the Salween, and then
                  returned to Russia. His fourth journey in 1883-1885 was to Sining (the great trade
                  centre of the Chinese borderland), and thence through northern Tibet (crossing the
                  Altyn Tagh to Lop Nor), and by the Cherchen-Keriya trade route to Khotan. From
                  Khotan he followed the Tarim to Aksu.</p>

                  of Tibet; all these Russian expeditions being conducted on scientific principles

                                <p>Although the establishment of a lucrative trade between India and central Asia
                  had been the dream of many successive Indian viceroys, and much had been done
                  towards improving the approaches to Simla from the north, very little was really
                  known of the highlands of the Pamirs, or of the regions of the great central
                  depression, before the mission of <name type="person">Sir Douglas Forsyth</name>
                  to Yarkand in 1870. <name type="person">Robert Barkley Shaw</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_W._Hayward">George

                  made the first maps of Chinese Turkestan. The next great accession to our
                  knowledge of central Asiatic geography was gained with <name type="institution">the Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission</name> of 1884-1886, when Afghan Turkestan
                  and the Oxus regions were mapped by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Holdich">Colonel Sir T.H.

                  and returned to India by the Bashgol valley of Kafiristan. This was <name type="person">Colonel Woodthorpe</name>'s opportunity, and he was then enabled
                  to verify the results of <name type="person">W.W.M. Nair</name>'s previous
                  explorations, and to determine the conformation of the Hindu Kush. In 1885 <name type="person">Arthur Douglas Carey</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Dalgleish">Andrew Dalgleish</name>,

                    Rockhill</name>, commenced his Tibetan journeys, and also attempted to reach
                  Lhasa, without success. By his writings, as much as by his explorations, <name type="person">Rockhill</name> has made his name great in the annals of Asiatic
                  research. In 1891 <name type="person">Hamilton Bower</name> made his famous

                  portals of Lhasa; but he secured (with the assistance of a native surveyor) a
                  splendid addition to our previous Tibetan mapping. In 1891-1892-1893 the gallant

                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._George_Littledale">Littledale</name>'s first journey ended at Peking ; his second, in 1894-1895,
                  took him almost within sight of the sacred walls of Lhasa, but he failed to pass
                  inside. Greatest among modern Asiatic explorers (if we except <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolai_Przhevalsky">Prjevalsky</name>) is the
                  brave Swede, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sven_Hedin">Professor Sven Hedin</name>, whose travels through the deserts of Takla Makan
                  and Tibet, and whose investigations in the glacial regions of the Sarikol
                  mountains, occupied him from 1894 to 1896. His is a truly monumental record. From
                  1896 to 1898 we find two British cavalry officers taking the front position in the

                  opportunities afforded by the systematic survey of Baluchistan which has been
                  steadily progressing since 1880—combined to produce a series of geographical maps

                                <p>In northern Asia it is impossible to follow in detail the results of the
                  organized Russian surveys. The vast steppes and forest-clad mountain regions of
                  Siberia have assumed a new geographical aspect in the light of these revelations,
                  and already promise a new world of economic resources to Russian enterprise in the
                  near future. A remarkable expedition by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Toll">Baron Toll</name> in 1892 through
                  the regions watered by the Lena, resulted in the collection of material which <pb n="740" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0740.png"/> will greatly help to

                                <p>In no other period of the world's history, of equal length of time, has so much
                  scientific enterprise been directed towards the field of Asiatic inquiry. The
                  first great result of recent geographical research has been to modify pre-existing
                  ideas of the orography of the vast central region represented by Tibet and
                  Mongolia. The great highland plateau which stretches from the Himalaya northwards
                  to Chinese Turkestan, and from the frontier of Kashmir eastwards to China, has now
                  been defined with comparative geographical exactness. The position of Sachu (or
                  Saitu) in Mongolia may be taken as an obligatory point in modern map construction.
                  The longitude value now adopted is 94º 54' E. of Greenwich, which is the revised

                                <p>South and west the bounding territories are well fixed in geograpical position by
                  the Indian survey determinations of the value of Himalayan peaks. On the north the
                  Chinese Turkestan explorations are now brought into survey connexion with Kashmir
                  and India.</p>
                                <p>No longer do we regard the Kuen-lun mountains, which extend from the frontiers of
                  Kashmir, north of Leh, almost due east to the Chinese province of Kansu, as the
                  southern limit of the Gobi or Turkestan depression. This very remarkable
                  longitudinal chain is undoubtedly the northern limit of the Chang Tang, the
                  elevated highland steppes of Tibet; but from it there branches a minor system to
                  the north-east from a point in about 830 E. longitude, which culminates in the
                  Altyn Tagh, and extends eastwards in a continuous water-divide to the Nan Shan
                  mountains, north of the Koko Nor basin. Thus between Tibet and the low-lying sands
                  of Gobi we have, thrust in, a system of elevated valleys (Tsaidam), 8000 to 9000
                  ft. above sea-level, forming an intermediate steppe between the highest regions
                  and the lowest, east of Lop Nor. All this is comparatively new geography, and it
                  goes far to explain why the great trade routes from Peking to the west were pushed
                  so far to the north.</p>

                  and China is defined by the meridional range of Sarikol. This range (known to the
                  ancients as Taurus and in medieval times as Bolor) like many others of the most
                  important great natural mountain divisions of the world, consists of two parallel
                  chains, of which the western is the water-divide of the Pamirs, and the eastern
                  (which has been known as the Kashgar or Kandar range) is split at intervals by
                  lateral gorges to allow of the passage of the main drainage from the eastern Pamir
                  slopes.</p>

                                <p>In western Asia we have learned the exact value of the mountain barrier which
                  lies between Merv and Herat, and have mapped its connexion with the Elburz of
                  Persia. We can now fully appreciate the factor in practical politics which that
                  definite but somewhat irregular mountain system represents which connects the
                  water-divide north of Herat with the southern abutment of the Hindu Kush, near
                  Bamian. Every pass of importance is known and recorded; every route of
                  significance has been explored and mapped ; Afghanistan has assumed a now
                  political entity by the demarcation of a boundary ; the value of Herat and of the
                  Pamirs as bases of aggression has been assessed, and the whole intervening space
                  of mountain and plain thoroughly examined.</p>

                                <p>Although within the limits of western Asiatic states, still under Asiatic
                  government and beyond the active influence of European interests, the material
                  progress of the Eastern world has appeared to remain stationary, yet large
                  accessions to geographical knowledge have at least been made, and in some
                  instances a deeper knowledge of the surface of the country and modern conditions
                  of life has led to the straightening of many crooked paths in history, and a
                  better appreciation of the slow processes of advancing civilization. The steady
                  advance of scientific inquiry into every corner of Persia, backed by the unceasing
                  efforts of a new school of geographical explorers, has left nothing unexamined
                  that can be subjected to superficial observation. The geographical map of the
                  country is fairly complete, and with it much detailed information is now
                  accessible regarding the coast and harbours of the Persian Gulf, the routes and
                  passes of the interior, and the possibilities of commercial development by the
                  construction of trade roads uniting the Caspian, the Karun, the Persian Gulf, and
                  India, via Seistan. Persia has assumed a comprehensible position as a factor in

                                <p>The great central depression of the continent which reaches from the foot of the
                  Pamir plateau on the west through the Tarim desert to Lop Nor and the Gobi has
                  yielded up many interesting secrets. The remarkable phenomenon of the periodic
                  shifting of the Lop Nor system has been revealed by the researches of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sven_Hedin">Sven Hedin</name>,
                  and the former existence of highly civilized centres of Buddhist art and industry
                  in the now sand-strewn wastes of the Turkestan desert has been clearly
                  demonstrated by the same great explorer and by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aurel_Stein">Dr M.A. Stein</name>. The
                  depression westward of the Caspian and Aral basins, and the original connexion of
                  these seas, have also come under the close investigation of Russian scientists,
                  with the result that the theory of an ancient connexion between the Oxus and the
                  Caspian has been displaced by the more recent hypothesis of an extension of the
                  Caspian Sea eastwards into Trans-Caspian territory within the post- Pleiocene age.
                  The discovery of shells (now living in the Caspian} at a distance of about 100 m.
                  inland, at an altitude of 140 to 280 ft. above the present level of the Caspian,
                  gives support to this hypothesis, which is further advanced by the ascertained
                  nature of the Kara-kum sands, which appear to be a purely marine formation
                  exhibiting no traces of fluviatile deposits which might be considered as delta
                  deposits of the Oxus.</p>
                                <p>In the discussion of this problem we find the names of <name type="person">Baron

                  Further matter of interest in connexion with the Oxus basin was elucidated by the
                  researches of <name type="person">L. Griesbach</name> in connexion with <name type="institution">the Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission</name>. He reported the
                  gradual formation of an anticlinal or ridge extending longitudinally through the
                  great Balkh plain of Afghan Turkestan, which effectually shuts off the northern
                  affluents of that basin from actual junction with the river. This evidence of a
                  gradual process of upheaval still in action may throw some light on the physical
                  (especially the climatic) changes which must have passed over that part of Asia
                  since Balkh was the <q>" mother of cities,"</q> the great trade centre of Asia,
                  and the plains of Balkh were green with cultivation. In the restoration of the

                  interest, filling up a blank in the identification of sites mentioned by early

                  than the hydrography of the strange mountain wilderness that divides Tibet and
                  Burma from China. In this field the researches of travellers already mentioned,
                  combined with the more exact reconnaissance of native surveyors and of those
                  exploring parties which have recently been working in the interests of commercial
                  projects, have left little to future inquiry. We know now for certain that the
                  great Tsanpo of Tibet and the Brahmaputra are one and the same river; that north
                  of the point where the great countermarch of that river from east to west is
                  effected are to be found the sources of the Salween, the Mekong, the
                  Yang-tsze-kiang and the Hwang-ho, or Yellow river, in order, from west to east ;
                  and that south of it, thrust in between the extreme eastern edge of the
                  Brahmaputra basin <pb n="741" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0741.png"/> and
                  the Salween, rise the dual sources of the Irrawaddy. From the water-divide which
                  separates the most eastern affluent of the Brahmaputra, eastwards to the deep
                  gorges which enclose the most westerly branch of the upper Yang-tsze-kiang (here
                  running from north to south), is a short space of 100 m. ; and within that space
                  two mighty rivers, the Salween and the Mekong, send down their torrents to Burma
                  and Siam. These three rivers flow parallel to each other for some 300 m., deep
                  hidden in narrow and precipitous troughs, amidst some of the grandest scenery of
                  Asia ; spreading apart where the Yang-tsze takes its course eastwards, not far
                  north of the parallel of 25º.</p>
                                <p>The comparatively restricted area which still remains for close investigation
                  includes the most easterly sources of the Brahmaputra, the most northerly sources

                  been an era of boundary-making in Asia, of defining the politico-geographical
                  limits of empire, and of determining the responsibilities of government. Russia,
                  Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, India and China have all revised their borders,
                  and with the revision the political relations between these countries have
                  acquired a new and more assured basis. See also the articles on the different

                                <p>The advance of Russia to the Turkoman deserts and the Oxus demanded a definite
                  boundary between her trans-Caspian conquests and the kingdom of Afghanistan. This
                  was determined on the north-west by <name type="institution">the Russo-Afghan
                    Boundary Commission</name> of 1884-I886. A boundary was then fixed between the
                  Hari Rud (the river of Herat) and the Oxus, which is almost entirely artificial in
                  its construction. Zulfikar, where the boundary leaves the Hari Rud, is about 70 m.
                  south of Sarakhs, and the most southerly point of the boundary (where it crosses
                  the Kushk) is about 60 m. north of Herat. From the junction of the boundary with
                  the Oxus at Khamiab about 150 m. above the crossing-point of the Russian
                  Trans-Caspian railway at Charjui, the main channel of the Oxus river becomes the
                  northern boundary of Afghanistan, separating that country from Russia, and so
                  continues to its source in Victoria Lake of the Great Pamir. Beyond this point
                    <name type="institution">the Anglo-Russian Commission</name> of 1895 demarcated
                  a line to the snowfields and glaciers which overlook the Chinese border. Between
                  the Russian Pamirs and Chinese Turkestan the rugged line of the Sarikol range
                  intervenes, the actual dividing line being still indefinite. Beyond Kashgar the
                  southern boundary of Siberia follows an irregular course to the north-east, partly
                  defined by the Tian-shan and Alatau mountains, till it attains a northerly point
                  in about 53° N. lat. marked by the Sayan range to the west of Irkutsk. It then
                  deflects south-east till it touches the Kerulen affluent of the Amur river at a
                  point which is shown in unofficial maps as about 117º 30'E. long, and 49º 20' N.
                  lat. From here it follows this affluent to its junction with the Amur river, and
                  the Amur river to its junction with the Usuri. It follows the Usuri to its head
                  (its direction now being a little west of south), and finally strikes the Pacific
                  coast on about 42º 30' N. lat. at the month of the Tumen river 100 m. south of the
                  Amur bay, at the head of which lies the Russian port of Vladivostok. At two points
                  the Russian boundary nearly approaches that of provinces which are directly under
                  British suzerainty. Where the Oxus river takes its great bend to the north from
                  Ishkashim, the breadth of the Afghan territory intervening between that river and
                  the main water-divide of the Hindu Kush is not more than 10 or 12 m. ; and east of
                  the Pamir extension of Afghanistan, where the Beyik Pass crosses the Sarikol range
                  and drops into the Taghdumbash Pamir, there is but the narrow width of the
                  Karachukar valley between the Sarikol and the Muztagh. Here, however, the boundary
                  is again undefined. Eastwards of this the great Kashgar depression, which includes
                  the Tarim desert, separates Russia from the vast sterile highlands of Tibet; and a
                  continuous series of desert spaces of low elevation, marking the limits of a
                  primeval inland sea from the Sarikol meridional watershed to the Khingan mountains
                  on the western borders of Manchuria, divide her from the northern provinces of
                  China. From the Khingan ranges to the Pacific, south of the Amur, stretch the rich
                  districts of Manchuria, a province which connects Russia with the Korea by a
                  series of valleys formed by the Sungari and its affluents—a land of hill and
                  plain, forest and swamp, possessing a delightful climate, and vast undeveloped
                  agricultural resources. Throughout this land of promise Russian influence was
                  destroyed by Japan in the war of 1904. The possession of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lüshunkou_District">Port Arthur</name>, and
                  direct political control over Korea, place Japan in the dominant position as
                  regards Manchuria.</p>

                                <p>Coincident with the demarcation of Russian boundaries in Turkestan was that of
                  northern Afghanistan. From the Hari Rud on the west to the Sarikol mountains on
                  the east her northern Afghan limits were set by <name type="institution">the
                    Boundary Commissions</name> of 1884-1886 and of 1895 respectively. Her southern
                  and eastern boundaries were further defined by a series of minor commissions,
                  working on the basis of the Kabul agreement of 1893, which lasted for nearly four
                  years, terminating with the Mohmand settlement at the close of an expedition in
                  1897.</p>
                                <p>The Pamir extension of Afghan territory to the north-east reaches to a point a
                  little short of 75° E., from whence it follows the waterdivide to the head of the
                  Taghdumbash Pamir, and is thenceforward defined by the water-parting of the Hindu
                  Kush. It leaves the Hindu Kush near the Dorah Pass at the head of one of the minor
                  Chitral affluents, and passing south-west divides Kafiristan from Chitral and
                  Bajour, separates the sections of the Mohmands who are within the respective
                  spheres of Afghan and British sovereignty, and crosses the Peshawar-Kabul route at
                  Lundi-Khana. It thus places a broad width of independent territory between the
                  boundaries of British India (which have remained practically, though not
                  absolutely, untouched) and Afghanistan; and this independent belt includes Swat,
                  Bajour and a part of the Mohmand territory north of the Kabul river. The same
                  principle of maintaining an intervening width of neutral territory between the two
                  countries is definitely established throughout the eastern borders of Afghanistan,
                  along the full length of which a definite boundary has been demarcated to the
                  point where it touches the northern limits of Baluchistan on the Gomal river. From
                  the Gomal Baluchistan itself becomes an intervening state between British India
                  and Afghanistan, and the dividing line between Baluchistan and Afghanistan is laid
                  down with all the precision employed on the more northerly sections of the
                  demarcation.</p>

                  nations, such as Afghanistan undoubtedly is. Baluchistan independence demands
                  qualification. There is British Baluchistan <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                        <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>
                                    </foreign>, and there is the rest of Baluchistan which exists in various degrees
                  of independence, but is everywhere subject to British control. British Baluchistan
                  officially includes the districts of Peshin, Sibi and of Thal-Chotiali. As these
                  districts had originally been Afghan, they were transferred to British authority
                  by the treaty of Gandamak in 1879, although nominally they had been handed over to
                  Kalat forty years previously. Now they form an official province of British
                  Baluchistan within <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluchistan_Agency">the Baluchistan
                    Agency</name>; and the agency extends from the Gomal to the Arabian Sea and the
                  Persian frontier. Within this agency there are districts as independent as any in
                  Afghanistan, but the political status of the province as a whole is almost
                  precisely that of the native states of the Indian peninsula. The agent to the
                  governor-general of India, with a staff of political assistants, practically
                  exercises supreme control.</p>

                                <p>The increase of Russian influence on the northern Persian border and its
                  extension southwards towards Seistan led to the appointment of a British consul at
                  Kirman, the dominating town of southern Khorasan, directly connected with Meshed
                  on the north ; and the acquisition of rights of administration of the Nushki
                  district secured to Great Britain the trade between Seistan and Quetta by the new
                  Helmund desert route.</p>

                                <p>While British India has so far avoided actual geographical contact with one great
                  European power in Asia on the north and west, she has touched another on the east.
                  The Mekong river which limits British interests in Burma limits also those of
                  France in Tongking. The eastern boundaries of Burma are not yet fully demarcated
                  on the Chinese frontier. At a point level in latitude with Mogaung, near the
                  northern termination of the Burmese railway system, this boundary is defined by
                  the eastern watershed of the Nmaikha, the eastern of the two great northern
                  affluents of the Irrawaddy. Then it follows an irregular course southwards to a
                  position south-east of Bhamo in lat. 24º. It next defines the northern edge of the
                  Shan States, and finally strikes the Mekong river in lat. 21º 45' (approximately).
                  From that point southwards the river becomes the boundary between the Shan States
                  and Tongking for some 200 m., the channel of the river defining the limits of
                  occupation (though not entirely of interest) between French and British subjects.
                  Approximately on the parallel of 20º N. lat. the Burmese boundary leaves the
                  Mekong to run westwards towards the Salween, and thereafter following the eastern
                  watershed of the Salween basin it divides the Lower Burma provinces from Siam.</p>

                                <p>The geology of Asia is so complex and over wide areas so little known that it is
                  difficult to give a connected account of either the structure or the development
                  of the continent, and only the broader features can be dealt with here.</p>
                                <p>In the south, in Syria, Arabia and the peninsula of India, none but the oldest
                  rocks are folded, and the Upper Palaeozoic, the Mesozoic and the Tertiary beds lie
                  almost horizontally upon them. It is a region of quiescence or of faulting, but
                  not of folding. North of this lies a broad belt in which the Mesozoic deposits and
                  even the lower divisions of the Tertiary system are thrown into folds which extend
                  in a series of arcs from west to east and now form the principal mountain ranges
                  of central Asia. This belt includes Asia Minor, Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan,
                  the Himalayas, the Tian-shan, and, although they are very different in direction,
                  the Burmese ranges. The Kuen-lun, Nan-shan and the mountain ranges of southern
                  China are, perhaps, of earlier date, but nevertheless they lie in the same belt.
                  It is not true that throughout the whole width of this zone the beds are folded.
                  There are considerable tracts which are but little disturbed, but these tracts are
                  enclosed within the arcs formed by the folds, and the zone taken as a whole is
                  distinctly one of crumpling. North of the folded belt, and including the greater
                  part of Siberia, Mongolia and northern China, lies another area which is, in
                  general, free from any important folding of Mesozoic or Tertiary age. There are,
                  it is true, mountain ranges which are formed of folded beds, but in many cases the
                  direction of the chains is different from that of the folds, so that the ranges
                  must owe their elevation to other causes; and the folds, moreover, are of ancient
                  date, for the most part Archaean or Palaeozoic. The configuration of the region is
                  largely due to faulting, trough-like or tray-like depressions being formed, and
                  the intervening strips, which have not been depressed, standing up as mountain
                  ridges. Over a large part of Siberia and in the north of China, even the Cambrian
                  beds still he as horizontally as they were first laid down. In the extreme north,
                  in the Verkhoyansk range and in the mountains of the Taimyr peninsula, there are
                  indications of another zone of folding of Mesozoic or later date, but our
                  information concerning these ranges is very scanty. Besides the three chief
                  regions into which the mainland is thus seen to be divided, attention should be
                  drawn to the festoons of islands which border the eastern side of the continent,
                  and which are undoubtedly due to causes similar to those which produced the folds
                  of the folded belt.</p>
                                <p>Of all the Asiatic ranges the Himalayan is, geologically, the best known ; and
                  the evidence which it affords shows clearly that the folds to which it owes its
                  elevation were produced by an overthrust <pb n="743" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0743.png"/> from the north. It is, indeed, as
                  if the high land of central Asia had been pushed southward against and over the
                  unyielding mass formed by the old rocks of the Indian peninsula, and in the
                  process the edges of the over-riding strata had been crumpled and folded.
                  Overlooking all smaller details, we may consider Asia to consist of a northern
                  mass and a southern mass, too rigid to crumple, but not too strong to fracture,
                  and an intermediate belt of softer rock which was capable of folding. If then by
                  the contraction of the earth's interior the outer crust were forced to accommodate
                  itself to a smaller nucleus, the central softer belt would yield by crumpling; the
                  more rigid masses to the north and south, if they gave way at all, would yield by
                  faulting. It is interesting to observe, as will be shown later, that during the
                  Mesozoic era there was a land-mass in the north of Asia and another in the south,
                  and between them lay the sea in which ordinary marine sediments were deposited.
                  The belt of folding does not precisely coincide with this central sea, but the
                  correspondence is fairly close.</p>
                                <p>The present outline of the eastern coast and the nearly enclosed seas which lie
                  between the islands and the mainland, are attributed by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_von_Richthofen">Richthofen</name>
                  chiefly to simple faulting.</p>
                                <p>Little is known of the early geological history of Asia beyond the fact that a
                  large part of the continent was covered by the sea during the Cambrian and
                  Ordovician periods. But there is positive evidence that much of the north and east
                  of Asia has been land since the Palaeozoic era, and it has been conclusively
                  proved that the peninsula of India has never been beneath the sea since the
                  Carboniferous period at least. Between these ancient land masses lies an area in
                  which marine deposits of Mesozoic age are well developed and which was evidently
                  beneath the sea during the greater part of the Mesozoic era. The northern
                  land-mass has been named <name type="place">Angaraland</name> by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">E. Suess</name> ;
                  the southern, of which the Indian peninsula is but a fragment, is called <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name> by
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melchior_Neumayr">Neumayr</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name> and others ; while
                  the intervening sea is the central Mediterranean sea of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melchior_Neumayr">Neumayr</name> and <name type="place">the Tethys</name> of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name>. The greater part of
                  western Asia, including the basin of the Obi, the drainage area of the Aral Sea,
                  together with Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Persia and Arabia, was covered by the sea
                  during the later stages of the Cretaceous period ; but a considerable part of this
                  region was probably dry land in Jurassic times.</p>
                                <p>The northern land-mass begins in the north with the area which lies between the
                  Yenisei and the Lena. Here the folded Archean rocks are overlaid by Cambrian and
                  Ordovician beds, which still lie for the most part flat and undisturbed. Upon
                  these rest patches of freshwater deposits containing numerous remains of plants.
                  They consist chiefly of sandstone and conglomerate, but include workable seams of
                  coal. Some of the deposits appear to be of Permian age, but others are probably
                  Jurassic ; and they are all included under the general name of the Angara series.
                  Excepting in the extreme north, where marine Jurassic and Cretaceous fossils have
                  been found, there is no evidence that this part of Siberia has been beneath the
                  sea since the early part of the Palaeozoic era. Besides the plant beds extensive
                  outflows of basic lava rest directly upon the Cambrian and Ordovician strata. The
                  date of these eruptions is still uncertain, but they probably continued to a very
                  recent period.</p>
                                <p>South and east of the Palaeozoic plateau is an extensive area consisting chiefly
                  of Archean rocks, and including the greater part of Mongolia north of the
                  Tian-shan. Here again there are no marine beds of Mesozoic or Tertiary age, while
                  plant-bearing deposits belonging to the Angara series are known. Structurally, the
                  folds of this region are of ancient date ; but the area is crossed by a series of
                  depressions formed by faults, and the intervening strips, which have not been
                  depressed to the same extent, now stand up as mountain ranges. Farther south, in
                  the Chinese provinces of Shansi and Shensi, the geological succession is similar
                  in some respects to that of the Siberian Palaeozoic plateau, but the sequence is
                  more complete. There is again a floor of folded Archean rocks overlaid by nearly
                  horizontal strata of Lower Palaeozoic age; but these are followed by marine beds
                  belonging to the Carboniferous period. From the Upper Carboniferous onward,
                  however, no marine deposits are known; and, as in Siberia, plant-bearing beds are
                  met with. Southern China is very different in structure, consisting largely of
                  folded mountain chains, but the geological succession is very similar, and
                  excepting near the Tibetan and Burmese borders, there are no marine deposits of
                  Mesozoic or Tertiary age.</p>
                                <p>Thus it appears that from the Arctic Ocean there stretches a broad area as far as
                  the south of China, in which no marine deposits of later date than Carboniferous
                  have yet been found, except in the extreme north. Freshwater and terrestrial
                  deposits of Mesozoic age occur in many places, and the conclusion is irresistible
                  that the greater part of this area has been land since the close of the Palaeozoic
                  era. The Triassic deposits of the Verkhoyansk Range show that this land did not
                  extend to the Bering Sea ; while the marine Mesozoic deposits of Japan on the
                  east, the western Tian-shan on the west and Tibet on the south give us some idea
                  of its limits in other directions.</p>
                                <p>In the same way the entire absence of any marine fossils in the peninsula of
                  India, excepting near its borders, and the presence of the terrestrial and
                  freshwater deposits of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwana</name> series, representing
                  the whole of the geological scale from the top of the Carboniferous to the top of
                  the Jurassic, show that this region also has been land since the Carboniferous
                  period. It was a portion of a great land-mass which probably extended across the
                  Indian Ocean and was at one time united with the south of Africa.</p>
                                <p>But these two land-masses were not connected. Between India and China there is a
                  broad belt in which marine deposits of Mesozoic and Tertiary age are well
                  developed. Marine Tertiary beds occur in Burma ; in the Himalayas and in south
                  Tibet there is a nearly complete series of marine deposits from the Carboniferous
                  to the Eocene ; in Afghanistan the Mesozoic beds are in part marine and in part
                  fluviatile. The sea in which these strata were deposited seems to have attained
                  its greatest extension in Upper Cretaceous times, when its waters spread over the
                  whole of western Asia and even encroached slightly upon the Indian land. The
                  Eocene sea, however, cannot have been much inferior in extent.</p>
                                <p>It was after the Eocene period that the main part of the elevation of the
                  Himalayas took place, as is shown by the occurrence of nummulitic limestone at a
                  height of 20,000 ft. The formation of this and of the other great mountain chains
                  of central Asia resulted in the isolation of portions of the former central sea ;
                  and the same forces finally led to the elevation of the whole region and the union
                  of the old continents of <name type="place">Angara</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwana</name>. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name>, however, did not
                  long survive, and the portion which lay between India and South Africa sank
                  beneath the waves in Tertiary times.</p>
                                <p>Leaving out of consideration all evidence of more ancient volcanic activity, each
                  of the three regions, into which, as we have seen, the continent may be divided,
                  has been, during or since the Cretaceous period, the seat of great volcanic
                  eruptions. In the southern region of unfolded beds are found the lavas of the <q>"
                    harras "</q> of Arabia, and in India the extensive flows of the Deccan Trap. In
                  the central folded belt lie the great volcanoes, now mostly extinct, of Asia
                  Minor, Armenia, Persia and Baluchistan. In Burma also there is at least one
                  extinct volcano. In the northern unfolded region great flows of basic lava lie
                  directly upon the Cambrian and Ordovician beds of Siberia, but are certainly in
                  part of Tertiary age. Similar flows on a smaller scale occur in Manchuria, Korea
                  and northern China. In all these cases, however, the eruptions have now almost
                  ceased; and the great volcanoes of the present day lie in the islands off the
                  eastern and south-eastern coasts.</p>

                            <p>Among the places on the globe where the temperature falls lowest are some in
                northern Asia, and among those where it rises highest are some in southern Asia. The
                mean temperature of the north coast of eastern Siberia is but a few degrees above
                the zero of Fahrenheit; the lowest mean temperature anywhere observed is about 4º
                Fahr., at Melville Island, north of the American continent. The isothermals of mean
                annual temperature lie over northern Asia on curves tolerably regular in their
                outline, having their western branches in a somewhat higher latitude than their
                eastern ; a reduction of 1° of latitude corresponds approximately—and irrespective
                of modifications due to elevation —to a rise of 1/2° Fahr., as far say as 30º N.,
                where the mean temperature is about 75° Fahr. Farther south the increase is slower,
                and the highest mean temperature anywhere attained in southern Asia is not much
                above 82° Fahr.</p>
                            <p>The variations of temperature are very great in Siberia, amounting near the coast
                to more than 100° Fahr., between the mean of the hottest and coldest months, and to
                still more between the extreme temperatures of those months. In southern Asia, and
                particularly near the sea, the variation between the hottest and coldest monthly
                means is very much less, and under the equator it is reduced to about 5º. In Siberia
                the difference between the means of the hottest and coldest months is hardly
                anywhere less than 60° Fahr. On the Sea of Aral it is 80° Fahr. ; and at Astrakhan,
                on the Caspian, more than 50°. At Tiflis it is 45º. In northern China, at Peking, it
                is 55°, reduced to 30° at Canton, and to 20º at Manila. In northern India the
                greatest difference does not exceed 40°; and it falls off to about 15° at Calcutta,
                and to about 10° or 12° at Bombay and Madras. The temperatures at the head of the
                Persian Gulf approximate to those of northern India, and those of Aden to Madras. At
                Singapore the range is less than 5°; and at Batavia in Java, and Galle in Ceylon, it
                is about the same. The extreme temperatures in Siberia may be considered to lie
                between 80° and 90º Fahr. for maxima, and between -40º and -70° Fahr. for minima.
                The extreme of heat near the Caspian and Aral Seas rises to nearly 100° Fahr., while
                that of cold falls to -20º Fahr. or lower. Compared with these figures, we find in
                southern Asia 110º or 112° Fahr. as a maximum hardly ever exceeded. The absolute
                minimum in northern India, in lat. 30º, hardly goes below 32° ; at Calcutta it is
                about 40º, though the thermometer seldom falls to 50°. At Madras it rarely falls as
                low as 65°, or at Bombay below 60°. At Singapore and Batavia the thermometer very
                rarely falls below 70°, or rises above 90º. At Aden the minimum is a few degrees
                below 70°, the maximum not much exceeding 90º.</p>
                            <pb n="744" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0744.png"/>
                            <p>These figures sufficiently indicate the main characteristics of the air
                temperatures of Asia. Throughout its northern portion the winter is long and of
                extreme severity ; and even down to the circle of 35° N. lat., the minimum
                temperature is almost as low as zero of Fahrenheit. The summers are hot, though
                short in the northern latitudes, the maximum of summer heat being comparatively
                little less than that observed in the tropical countries farther south. The
                moderating effect of the proximity of the ocean is felt in an important degree along
                the southern and eastern parts of Asia, where the land is broken up into islands or
                peninsulas. The great elevations above the sea-level of the central part of Asia,
                and of the table-lands of Afghanistan and Persia, tend to exaggerate the winter cold
                ; while the sterility of the surface, due to the small rainfall over the same
                region, operates powerfully in the opposite direction in increasing the summer heat.
                In the summer a great accumulation of solar heat takes place on the dry surface
                soil, from which it cannot be released upwards by evaporation, as might be the case
                were the soil moist or covered with vegetation, nor can it be readily conveyed away
                downwards as happens on the ocean. In the winter similar consequences ensue, in a
                negative direction, from the prolonged loss of heat by radiation in the long and
                clear nights—an effect which is intensified wherever the surface is covered with
                snow, or the air little charged with vapour. In illustration of the very slow
                diffusion of heat in the solid crust of the earth, and as affording a further
                indication of the climate of northern Asia, reference may here be made to the frozen
                soil of Siberia, in the vicinity of Yakutsk. In this region the earth is frozen
                permanently to a depth of more than 380 ft. at which the temperature is still 5º or
                6° Fahr. below the freezing point of water, the summer heat merely thawing the
                surface to a depth of about 3 ft. At a depth of 50 ft. the temperature is about 15º
                Fahr. below the freezing point. Under such conditions of the soil, the land,
                nevertheless, produces crops of wheat and other grain from fifteen to forty
                fold.</p>
                            <p>The very high summer temperatures of the area north of the tropic of Cancer are
                sufficiently accounted for, when compared with those observed south of the tropic,
                by the increased length of the day in the higher latitude, which more than
                compensates for the loss of heat due to the smaller mid-day altitude of the sun. The
                difference between the heating power of the sun's rays at noon on the 21st of June,
                in latitude 20º and in latitude 45°, is only about 2 % ; while the accumulated heat
                received during the day, which is lengthened to 15 1/2 hours in the higher latitude,
                is greater by about 11 % than in the lower latitude, where the day consists only of
                13 1/4 hours.</p>
                            <p>Although the foregoing account of the temperatures of Asia supplies the main
                outline of the observed phenomena, a very important modifying cause, of which more
                will be said hereafter, comes into operation over the whole of the tropical region,
                namely, the periodical summer rains. These tend very greatly to arrest the increase
                of the summer heat over the area where they prevail, and otherwise give it
                altogether peculiar characteristics.</p>

                            <p>The great summer heat, by expanding the air upwards, disturbs the level of the
                planes of equal pressure, and causes an outflow of the upper strata from the heated
                area. The winter cold produces an effect of just an opposite nature, and causes an
                accumulation of air over the cold area. The diminution of barometric pressure which
                takes place all over Asia during the summer months, and the increase in the winter,
                are hence, no doubt, the results of the alternate heating and cooling of the air
                over the continent.</p>
                            <p>The necessary and immediate results of such periodical changes of pressure are
                winds, which, speaking generally, blow from the area of greatest to that of least
                pressure—subject, however, to certain modifications of direction, arising from the
                absolute motion of the whole body of the air due to the revolution of the earth on
                its axis from west to east. The south-westerly winds which prevail north of the
                equator during the hot half of the year, to which navigators have given the name of
                the south-west monsoon (the latter word being a corruption of the Indian name for
                season), arise from the great diminution of atmospheric pressure over Asia, which
                begins to be strongly marked with the great rise of temperature in April and May,
                and the simultaneous relatively higher pressure over the equator and the regions
                south of it. This diminution of pressure, which continues as the heat increases till
                it reaches its maximum in July soon after the solstice, is followed by the
                corresponding development of the south-west monsoon; and as the barometric pressure
                is gradually restored, and becomes equalized within the tropics soon after the
                equinox in October, with the general fall of temperature north of the equator, the
                south-west winds fall off, and are succeeded by a north-east monsoon, which is
                developed during the winter months by the relatively greater atmospheric pressure
                which then occurs over Asia, as compared with the equatorial region.</p>
                            <p>Although the succession of the periodical winds follows the progress of the seasons
                as just described, the changes in the wind's direction everywhere take place under
                the operation of special local influences which often disguise the more general law,
                and make it difficult to trace. Thus the south-west monsoon begins in the Arabian
                Sea with west and north-westerly winds, which draw round as the year advances to
                south-west and fall back again in the autumn by northwest to north. In the Bay of
                Bengal the strength of the southwest monsoon is rather from the south and
                south-east, being succeeded by north-east winds after October, which give place to
                northerly and north-westerly winds as the year advances. Among the islands of the
                Malay Archipelago the force of the monsoons is much interrupted, and the position of
                this region on the equator otherwise modifies the directions of the prevailing
                winds. The southerly summer winds of the Asiatic seas between the equator and the
                tropic do not extend to the coasts of Java, and the southeasterly trade winds are
                there developed in the usual manner. The China Sea is fully exposed to both
                monsoons, the normal directions of which nearly coincide with the centre of the
                channel between the continent of Asia and the eastern islands.</p>
                            <p>The south-west monsoon does not generally extend, in its character of a south-west
                wind, over the land. The current of air flowing in from over the sea is gradually
                diverted towards the area of least pressure, and at the same time is dissipated and
                loses much of its original force. The winds which pass northward over India blow as
                south-easterly and easterly winds over the north-eastern part of the Gangetic plain,
                and as south winds up the Indus. They seem almost entirely to have exhausted their
                northward velocity by the time they have reached the northern extremity of the great
                Indian plain ; they are not felt on the table-lands of Afghanistan, and hardly
                penetrate into the Indus basin or the ranges of the Himalaya, by which mountains,
                and those which branch off from them into the Malay peninsula, they are prevented
                from continuing their progress in the direction originally imparted to them.</p>
                            <p>Among the more remarkable phenomena of the hotter seas of Asia must be noticed the
                revolving storms or cyclones, which are of frequent occurrence in the hot months in
                the Indian Ocean and China Sea, in which last they are known under the name of
                typhoon. The cyclones of the Bay of Bengal appear to originate over the Andaman and
                Nicobar islands, and are commonly propagated in a north-westward direction, striking
                the east coast of the Indian peninsula at various points, and then often advancing
                with an easterly tendency over the land, and passing with extreme violence across
                the delta of the Ganges. They occur in all the hot months, from June to October, and
                more rarely in November, and appear to be originated by adverse currents from the
                north meeting those of the south-west monsoon. The cyclones of the China Sea also
                occur in the hot months of the year, but they advance from north-east to south-west,
                though occasionally from east to west; they originate near the island of Formosa,
                and extend to about the 10th degree of N. lat. They are thus developed in nearly the
                same latitudes and in the same months as those of the Indian Sea, though their
                progress is in a different direction. In both cases, however, the storms appear to
                advance towards the area of greatest heat. In these storms the wind invariably
                circulates from north by west through south to east.</p>

                            <p>The heated body of air carried from the Indian Ocean over southern Asia by the
                south-west monsoon comes up highly charged with watery vapour, and hence in a
                condition to release a large body of water as rain upon the land, whenever it is
                brought into circumstances which reduce its temperature in a notable degree. Such a
                reduction of temperature is brought about along the greater part of the coasts of
                India and of the Burmo- Siamese peninsula by the interruption of the wind current by
                continuous ranges of mountains, which force the mass of air to rise over them,
                whereby the air being rarefied, its specific capacity for heat is increased and its
                temperature falls, with a corresponding condensation of the vapour originally held
                in suspension.</p>
                            <p>This explanation of the principal efficient cause of the summer rains of south Asia
                is immediately based on an analysis of the complicated phenomena actually observed,
                and it serves to account for many apparent anomalies. The heaviest falls of rain
                occur along lines of mountain of some extent directly facing the vapour-bearing
                winds, as on the Western Ghats of India and the west coast of the Malay peninsula.
                The same results are found along the mountains at a distance from the sea, the
                heaviest rainfall known to occur anywhere in the world (not less than 600 in. in the
                year) being recorded on the Khasi range about 100 m. north-east of Calcutta, which
                presents an abrupt front to the progress of the moist winds flowing up from the Bay
                of Bengal. The cessation of the rains on the southern border of Baluchistan, west of
                Karachi, obviously arises from the projection of the south-east coast of Arabia,
                which limits the breadth of the south-west monsoon air current and the length of the
                coast-line directly exposed to it. The very small and irregular rainfall in Sind and
                along the Indus is to be accounted for by the want of any obstacle in the path of
                the vapour - bearing winds, which, therefore, carry the uncondensed rain up to the
                Punjab, where it falls on the outer ranges of the western Himalaya and of
                Afghanistan.</p>
                            <p>The diurnal mountain winds are very strongly marked on the Himalaya, where they
                probably are the most active agents in determining the precipitation of rain along
                the chain—the monsoon currents, as before stated, not penetrating among the
                mountains. The formation of dense banks of cloud in the afternoon, when the up wind
                is strongest, along the southern face of the snowy ranges of the Himalaya, is a
                regular daily phenomenon during the hotter months of the year, and heavy rain,
                accompanied by electrical discharges, is the frequent result of such
                condensation.</p>
                            <p>Too little is known of the greater part of Asia to admit of any more being said
                with reference to this part of the subject, than to <pb n="745" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0745.png"/> mention a few facts bearing on the
                rainfall. In northern Asia there is a generally equal rainfall of 19 to 29 in.
                between the Volga and the Lena in Manchuria and northern China, rather more
                considerable increase in Korea, Siam and Japan. At Tiflis the yearly fall is 22 in.;
                on the Caspian about 7 or 8 in.; on the Sea of Aral 5 or 6 in. In south-western
                Siberia it is 12 or 14 in., diminishing as we proceed eastward to 6 or 7 in. at
                Barnaul, and to 5 or 6 in. at Urga in northern Mongolia. In eastern Siberia it is
                about 15 to 20 in. In China we find about 23 in. to be the fall at Peking ; while at
                Canton, which lies nearly on the northern tropic and the region of the south-west
                monsoon is entered, the quantity is increased to 78 in. At Batavia in Java the fall
                is about 78 in. ; at Singapore it is nearly 100 in. The quantity increases
                considerably on that part of the coast of the Malay peninsula which is not sheltered
                from the south-west by Sumatra. On the Tenasserim and Burmese coast falls of more
                than 200 in. are registered, and the quantity is here nowhere less than 75 or 80
                in., which is about the average of the eastern part of the delta of the Ganges,
                Calcutta standing at about 64 in. On the hills that flank Bengal on the east the
                fall is very great. On the Khasi hills, at an elevation of about 4500 ft., the
                average of ten years is more than 550 in. As much as 150 in. has been measured in
                one month, and 610 in. in one year. On the west coast of the Indian peninsula the
                fall at the sea-level varies from about 75 to 100 in., and at certain elevations on
                the mountains more than 250 in. is commonly registered, with intermediate quantities
                at intervening localities. On the east coast the fall is far less, nowhere rising to
                50 in., and towards the southern apex of the peninsula being reduced to 25 or 30 in.
                Ceylon shows from 60 to 80 in. As we recede from the coast the fall diminishes, till
                it is reduced to about 25 or 30 in. at the head of the Gangetic plain. The tract
                along the Indus to within 60 or 80 m. of the Himalaya is almost rainless, 6 or 8 in.
                being the fall in the southern portion of the Punjab. On the outer ranges of the
                Himalaya the yearly fall amounts to about 200 in. on the east in Sikkim, and
                gradually diminishes on the west, where north of the Punjab it is about 70 or 80 in.
                In the interior of the chain the rain is far less, and the quantity of precipitation
                is so small in Tibet that it can be hardly measured. It is to the greatly reduced
                fall of snow on the northern faces of the highest ranges of the Himalaya that is to
                be attributed the higher level of the snow-line, a phenomenon which was long a cause
                of discussion.</p>
                            <p>In Afghanistan, Persia, Asia Minor and Syria, winter and spring appear to be the
                chief seasons of condensation. In other parts of Asia the principal part of the rain
                falls between May and September, that is, in the hottest half of the year. In the
                islands under the equator the heaviest fall is between October and February.</p>

                            <p>The general assemblage of animals and plants found over northern Asia resembles
                greatly that found in the parts of Europe which are adjacent and have a similar
                climate. Siberia, north of the 50th parallel, has a climate not much differing from
                a similarly situated portion of Europe, though the winters are more severe and the
                summers hotter. The rainfall, though moderate, is still sufficient to maintain the
                supply of water in the great rivers that traverse the country to the Arctic Sea, and
                to support an abundant vegetation. A similar affinity exists between the life of the
                southern parts of Europe and that in the zone of Asia extending from the
                Mediterranean across to the Himalaya and northern China. This belt, which embraces
                Asia Minor, northern Persia, Afghanistan, and the southern slopes of the Himalaya,
                from its elevation has a temperate climate, and throughout it the rainfall is
                sufficient to maintain a vigorous vegetation, while the summers, though hot, and the
                winters, though severe, are not extreme. The plants and animals along it are found
                to have a marked similarity of character to those of south Europe, with which region
                the zone is virtually continuous.</p>
                            <p>The extremely dry and hot tracts which constitute an almost unbroken desert from
                Arabia, through south Persia and Baluchistan, to Sind, are characterized by
                considerable uniformity in the types of life, which closely approach to those of the
                neighbouring hot and dry regions of Africa. The region of the heavy periodical
                summer rains and high temperature, which comprises India, the Indo- Chinese
                peninsula, and southern China, as well as the western part of the Malay Archipelago,
                is also marked by much similarity in the plants and animals throughout its extent.
                The area between the southern border of Siberia and the margin of the temperate
                alpine zone of the Himalaya and north China, comprising what are commonly called
                central Asia, Turkestan, Mongolia and western Manchuria, is an almost rainless
                region, having winters of extreme severity and summers of intense heat. Its animals
                and plants have a special character suited to the peculiar climatal conditions, more
                closely allied to those of the adjacent northern Siberian tract than of the other
                bordering regions. The south-eastern parts of the Malay Archipelago have much in
                common with the Australian continent, to which they adjoin, though their affinities
                are chiefly Indian. North China and Japan also have many forms of life in common.
                Much still remains to be done in the exploration of China and eastern Asia; but it
                is known that many of the special forms of this region extend to the Himalaya, while
                others clearly indicate a connexion with North America.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing brief review of the principal territorial divisions according to
                which the forms of life are distributed in Asia, indicates how close is the
                dependence of this distribution on climatic conditions, and this will be made more
                apparent by a somewhat fuller account of the main features of the flora and
                fauna.</p>

                                <p>—The flora of the whole of northern Asia is in essentials the same as that of
                  northern Europe, the differences being due rather to variations of species than of
                  genera. The absence of the oak and of all heaths east of the Ural may be noticed.
                  Pines, larch, birch are the principal trees on the mountains; willow, alders and
                  poplars on the lower ground. The northern limit of the pine in Siberia is about
                  70º N.</p>
                                <p>Along the warm temperate zone, from the Mediterranean to the Himalaya, extends a
                  flora essentially European in character. Many European species reach the central
                  Himalaya, though few are known in its eastern parts. The genera common to the
                  Himalaya and Europe are much more abundant, and extend throughout the chain, and
                  to all elevations. There is also a corresponding diffusion of Japanese and Chinese
                  forms along this zone, these being most numerous in the eastern Himalaya, and less
                  frequent in the west.</p>
                                <p>The truly tropical flora of the hotter and wetter regions of eastern India is
                  continuous with that of the Malayan peninsula and islands, and extends along the
                  lower ranges of the Himalaya, gradually becoming less marked and rising to lower
                  elevations as we go westward, where the rainfall diminishes and the winter cold
                  increases.</p>
                                <p>The vegetation of the higher and therefore cooler and less rainy ranges of the
                  Himalaya has greater uniformity of character along the whole chain, and a closer
                  general approach to European forms is maintained; an increased number of species
                  is actually identical, among these being found, at the greatest elevations, many
                  alpine plants believed to be identical with species of the north Arctic regions.
                  On reaching the Tibetan plateau, with the increased dryness the flora assumes many
                  features of the Siberian type. Many true Siberian species are found, and more
                  Siberian genera. Some of the Siberian forms, thus brought into proximity with the
                  Indian flora, extend to the rainy parts of the mountains, and even to the plains
                  of upper India. Assemblages of marine plants form another remarkable feature of
                  Tibet, these being frequently met with growing at elevations of 14,000 to 15,000
                  ft. above the sea, more especially in the vicinity of the many salt lakes of those
                  regions.</p>
                                <p>The vegetation of the hot and dry region of the south-west of the continent
                  consists largely of plants which are diffused over Africa, Baluchistan and Sind ;
                  many of these extend into the hotter parts of India, and not a few common Egyptian
                  plants are to be met with in the Indian peninsula.</p>

                  Asia, which includes India and the Malayan peninsula and islands, from about the
                  65th to the 105th meridian, was estimated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Dalton_Hooker">Sir J.D. Hooker</name> at
                  12,000 to 15,000. The principal orders, arranged according to their numerical
                  importance, are as follows :—Leguminosae, Rubiaceae, Orchidaceae, Compositae,
                  Gramineae, Euphorbiaceae, Acanthaceae, Cyperaceae and Labiatae. But within this
                  region there is a very great variation between the vegetation of the more humid
                  and the more arid regions, while the characteristics of the flora on the higher
                  mountain ranges differ wholly from those of the plains. In short, we have a
                  somewhat heterogeneous assemblage of tropical, temperate and alpine plants, as has
                  been already briefly indicated, of which, however, the tropical are so far
                  dominant as to give their character to the flora viewed as a whole. The Indian
                  flora contains a more general and complete illustration of almost all the chief
                  natural families of all parts of the world than any other country. Compositae are
                  comparatively rare ; so also Gramineae and Cyperaceae are in some places
                  deficient, and Labiatae, Leguminosae and ferns in others. Euphorbiaceae and
                  Scrophulariaceae and Orchidaceae are universally present, the last in specially
                  large proportions.</p>

                                    </foreign> may be mentioned as a genus specially developed in the Malayan area,
                  and extending from New Caledonia to Madagascar; it is found as far north as the
                  Khasi hills, and in Ceylon, but does not appear on the Himalaya or in the
                  peninsula of India. The Balsaminaceae may be named as being rare in the eastern
                  region and very abundant in the peninsula. A distinct connexion between the flora
                  of the peninsula and Ceylon and that of eastern tropical Africa is observable not
                  only in the great similarity of many of the more truly tropical forms, and the
                  identity of families and genera found in both regions, but in a more remarkable
                  manner in the likeness of the mountain flora of this part of Africa to that of the
                  peninsula, in which several species occur believed to be identical with Abyssinian
                  forms. This connexion is further established by the absence from both areas of
                  oaks, conifers and cycads, which, as regards the first two families, is a
                  remarkable feature of the flora of the peninsula and Ceylon, as the mountains rise
                  to elevations in which both of them are abundant to the north and east. With these
                  facts it has to be noticed that many of the principal forms of the eastern flora
                  are absent or comparatively rare in the peninsula and Ceylon.</p>
                                <p>The general physiognomy of the Indian flora is mainly determined by the
                  conditions of humidity of climate. The impenetrable shady forests of the Malay
                  peninsula and eastern Bengal, of the west coast of the Indian peninsula, and of
                  Ceylon, offer a strong contrast to the more loosely timbered districts of the
                  drier regions of central India and the north-western Himalaya. The forest areas of
                  India include the dense vegetation and luxuriant growth of the Tarai jungles at
                  the foot of the eastern Himalaya, and wide stretches of loosely timbered country
                  which are a prevailing feature in the Central Provinces and parts of Madras. Where
                  the lowlands are highly cultivated they are adorned with planted wood, and where
                  they are cut off from rain they are nearly completely desert.</p>

                  12,000 ft., above which the sub-alpine region may be said to begin, in which
                  rhododendron scrub often covers the ground up to 13,000 or 14,000 ft. Only one
                  pine is found below 8000 ft., above which several other Coniferae occur.

                  orchids are very frequent, and reach even to 10,000 ft. Vegetation ascends on the
                  drier and less snowy mountain slopes of Tibet to above 18,000 ft. On the west,
                  with the drier climate, the forest is less luxuriant and dense, and the hill-sides
                  and the valleys better cultivated. The warm mountain slopes are covered with
                    <foreign xml:lang="la">

                  below 8000 ft., excepting in some of the more secluded valleys at a low elevation.
                  From 8000 to 12,000 ft., a thick forest of deciduous trees is almost universal,
                  above which a sub-alpine region is reached, and vegetation as on the east
                  continues up to 18,000 ft. or more. The more tropical forms of the east, such as
                  the tree-ferns, do not reach west of Nepal. The cedar or deodar is hardly
                  indigenous east of the sources of the Ganges, and at about the same point the
                  forms of the west begin to be more abundant, increasing in number as we advance

                  harvests of the tropical and temperate zones. North of the tropic the winter cold
                  is sufficient to admit of the cultivation of almost all the cereals and vegetables
                  of Europe, wheat being sown in November and reaped early in April. In this same
                  region the summer heat and rain provide a thoroughly tropical climate, in which
                  rice and other tropical cereals are freely raised, being as a rule sown early in
                  July and reaped in September or October. In southern India, and the other parts of
                  Asia and of the islands having a similar climate, the difference of the winter and
                  summer half-years is not sufficient to admit of the proper cultivation of wheat or
                  barley. The other cereals may be seen occasionally, where artificial irrigation is
                  practised, in all stages of progress at all seasons of the year, though the
                  operations of agriculture are, as a general rule, limited to the rainy months,
                  when alone is the requisite supply of water commonly forthcoming.</p>
                                <p>The trees of India producing economically useful timber are comparatively few,
                  owing to the want of durability of the wood, in the extremely hot and moist
                  climate. The teak, <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    </foreign>, supplies the finest timber. It is found in greatest perfection in the
                  forests of the west coasts of Burma and the Indian peninsula, where the rainfall
                  is heaviest, growing to a height of 100 or 150 ft., mixed with other trees and
                  bamboos. The sal, <foreign xml:lang="la">

                  from Assam to the Punjab, and is found in central India, to which the teak also
                  extends. The sal grows to a large size, and is more gregarious than the teak. Of

                                <p>The flora of the rainless region of south-western Asia is continuous with the
                  desert flora of northern and eastern Africa, and extends from the coast of Senegal
                  to the meridian of 75º E., or from the great African desert to the border of the
                  rainless tract along the Indus and the southern parts of the Punjab. It includes
                  the peninsula of Arabia, the shores of the Persian Gulf, south Persia, and
                  Afghanistan and Baluchistan. On the west its limit is in the Cape Verde Islands,
                  and it is partially represented in Abyssinia.</p>
                                <p>The more common plants in the most characteristic part of this region in southern
                  Arabia are Capparidaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and a few Leguminosae, a <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    </foreign>; palms, Polygonaceae, ferns, and other cryptogams, are rare. The number
                  of families relative to the area is very small, and the number of genera and
                  species equally restricted, in very many cases a single species being the only
                  representative of an order. The aspect of the vegetation is very peculiar, and is
                  commonly determined by the predominance of some four or five species, the rest
                  being either local or sparingly scattered over the area. The absence of the
                  ordinary bright green colours of vegetation is another peculiarity of this flora,
                  almost all the plants having glaucous or whitened stems. Foliage is reduced to a
                  minimum, the moisture of the plant being stored up in massive or fleshy stems
                  against the long-continued drought. Aridity has favoured the production of spines
                  as a defence from external attack, sharp thorns are frequent, and asperities of
                  various sorts predominate. Many species produce gums and resins, their stems being
                  encrusted with the exudations, and pungency and aromatic odour is an almost
                  universal quality of the plants of desert regions.</p>
                                <p>The cultivated plants of Arabia are much the same as those Of northern

                  the summits of which rise to 6000 or 7000 ft., the rainfall is sufficient to
                  develop a more luxuriant vegetation, and the valleys have a flora like that of
                  similarly situated parts of southern Persia, and the less elevated parts of
                  Afghanistan and Baluchistan, partaking of the characters of that of the hotter
                  Mediterranean region. In these countries aromatic shrubs are abundant. Trees are

                  humidity leads to the predominance of certain tropical forms not so conspicuous in
                  India, while the proximity of the Australian continent has permitted the partial
                  diffusion of Australian types which are not seen in India. The liquidambar and
                  nutmeg may be noticed among <pb n="747" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0747.png"/> the former; the first is one of
                  the most conspicuous trees in Java, on the mountains of the eastern part of which
                  the casuarina, one of the characteristic forms of Australia, is also abundant.
                  Rhododendrons occur in Borneo and Sumatra, descending to the level of the sea. On
                  the mountains of Java there appears to be no truly alpine flora ; <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                <p>The analysis of the Hong Kong flora indicates that about three-fifths of the
                  species are common to the Indian region, and nearly all the remainder are either
                  Chinese or local forms. The number of species common to southern China, Japan and
                  northern Asia is small. The cultivated plants of China are, with a few exceptions,
                  the same as those of India. South China, therefore, seems, botanically, hardly
                  distinct from the great Indian region, into which many Chinese forms penetrate, as
                  before noticed. The flora of north China, which is akin to that of Japan, shows
                  manifest relation to that of the neighbouring American continent, from which many
                  temperate forms extend, reaching to the Himalaya, almost as far as Kashmir. Very
                  little is known of the plants of the interior of northern China, but it seems
                  probable that a complete botanical connexion is established between it and the
                  temperate region of the Himalaya.</p>

                  groups belong mostly to forms which are restricted to cold and temperate regions.
                  Consequently the Quadrumana, or monkeys, are nearly unrepresented, a single
                  species occurring in Japan, and one or two others in northern China and Tibet.
                  Insectivorous bats are numerous, but the frugivorous division of this order is
                  only represented by a single species in Japan. Carnivora are also numerous,
                  particularly the frequenters of cold climates, such as bears, weasels, wolves and
                  foxes. Of the Insectivora numerous forms of moles, shrews and hedgehogs prevail.
                  The Rodents are also well represented by various squirrels, mice and hares.

                  forms in northern Asia, especially those belonging to the typical genus <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                        <hi rend="italic">Cervus</hi>

                  peculiar types.</p>
                                <p>The ornithology of northern Asia is even more closely allied to that of Europe
                  than the mammal fauna. Nearly three-fourths of the well-known species of Europe
                  extend through Siberia into the islands of the Japanese empire. Here again we have
                  an absence of all tropical forms, and a great development of groups characteristic
                  of cold and temperate regions. One of the most peculiar of these is the genus

                  are well developed, and exhibit many species.</p>
                                <p>The mammal fauna of the Indian region of Asia is much more highly developed than
                  that of the Palaearctic. The Quadrumana are represented by several peculiar
                  genera, amongst which are <foreign xml:lang="la">

                  insectivorous and frugivorous divisions of the bats are well represented. Amongst
                  the Insectivora very peculiar forms are found, such as <foreign xml:lang="la">

                  considered as the true home of the tiger, though this animal has wandered far
                  north into the Palaearctic division of Asia. Other characteristic Carnivora are
                  civets, various ichneumons, and the benturong <foreign xml:lang="la">

                  the order of Rodents squirrels are very numerous, and porcupines of two genera are
                  met with. The Indian region is the home of the Indian elephant—one of the two sole
                  remaining representatives of the order Proboscidea. Of the Ungulates, four species
                  of rhinoceros and one of tapir are met with, besides several peculiar forms of the
                  swine family. The Bovidae, or hollow-horned ruminants, are represented by several

                                <p>The assemblage of birds of the Indian region is one of the richest and most

                  every order, except that of the Struthiones or ostriches, is well represented, and
                  there are many peculiar genera not found elsewhere, such as <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                <p>The Ethiopian fauna plays but a subordinate part in Asia, intruding only into the
                  south-western corner, and occupying the desert districts of Arabia and Syria,
                  although some of the characteristic species reach still farther into Persia and
                  Sind, and even into western India. The lion and the hunting-leopard, which may be
                  considered as, in this epoch at least, Ethiopian types, extend thus far, besides
                  various species of jerboa and other desert-loving forms.</p>
                                <p>In the birds, the Ethiopian type is shown by the prevalence of larks and
                  stone-chats, and by the complete absence of the many peculiar genera of the Indian
                  region.</p>
                                <p>The occurrence of mammals of the Marsupial order in the Molucca Islands and
                  Celebes, while none have been found in the adjacent islands of Java and Borneo,
                  lying on the west of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wallace_Line">Wallace's line</name>, or in the
                  Indian region, shows that the margin of the Australian region has here been
                  reached. The same conclusion is indicated by the absence from the Moluccas and
                  Celebes of various other Mammals, Quadrumana, Carnivora, Insectivora and
                  Ruminants, which abound in the western part of the Archipelago. Deer do not extend

                  rivers many hundred miles ; one of the best-known of Indian fishes, the hilsa, is
                  of this family. The sturgeons, which abound in the Black Sea and Caspian, and
                  ascend the rivers that fall into them, are also found in Asiatic Russia, and an
                  allied form extends to southern China. The walking or climbing fishes, which are
                  peculiar to south-eastern Asia and Africa, are organized so as to be able to
                  breathe when out of the water, and they are thus fitted to exist under conditions
                  which would be fatal to other fishes, being suited to live in the regions of

                  Siam and the Malayan Islands, belong to one group ; not only the genera, but even
                  the species are often the same on the opposite sides of the Bay of Bengal. The
                  connexion with Africa is marked by the occurrence of many genera common to Africa
                  and India, and confined to those two regions, and similarities of form are not
                  uncommon there in cases in which the genera are not peculiar. Of Coleopterous
                  insects known to inhabit east Siberia, nearly one-third are found in western
                  Europe. The European forms seem to extend to about 30° N., south of which the
                  Indo-Malayan types are met with, Japan being of the Europeo-Asiatic group. The
                  northern forms extend generally along the south coast of the Mediterranean up to
                  the border of the great desert, and from the Levant to the Caspian.</p>

                                <p>Of the domesticated animals of Asia may first be mentioned the elephant. It does
                  not breed in captivity, and is not found wild west of the Jumna river in northern
                  India. The horse is produceed in the highest perfection in Arabia and the hot and
                  dry countries of western Asia. Ponies are most esteemed from the wetter regions of
                  the east, and the hilly tracts. Asses are abundant in most places, and two wild
                  species occur. The horned cattle include the humped oxen and buffaloes of India,
                  and the yak of Tibet. A hybrid between the yak and Indian cattle, called zo, is
                  commonly reared in Tibet and the Himalaya. Sheep abound in the more temperate
                  regions, and goats are universally met with ; both of these animals are used as
                  beasts of burden in the mountains of Tibet. The reindeer of northern Siberia call
                  also for special notice; they are used for the saddle as well as for draught.</p>

                                <p>Asia, including its outlying islands, has become the dwelling-place of all the
                  great families into which the races of men have been divided. By far the largest
                  area is occupied by the Mongolian group. These have yellow-brown skins, black eyes
                  and hair, flat noses and oblique eyes. They are short in stature, with little hair
                  on the body and face. In general terms they extend, with modifications of
                  character probably due to admixture with other types and to varying conditions of
                  life, over the whole of northern Asia as far south as the plains bordering the
                  Caspian Sea, including Tibet and China, and also over the Indo- Malayan peninsula
                  and Archipelago, excepting Papua and some of the more eastern islands.</p>
                                <p>Next in numerical importance to the Mongolians are the races which have been
                  called by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">Professor Huxley</name>
                                    <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                        <hi rend="italic">Melanochroic</hi>
                                    </foreign> and <foreign rend="italic">Xanthochroic</foreign>. The former includes
                  the dark-haired people of southern Europe, and extends over North Africa, Asia
                  Minor, Syria to south-western Asia, and through Arabia and Persia to India. The
                  latter race includes the fair-haired people of northern Europe, and extends over
                  nearly the same area as the Melanochroi, with which race it is greatly intermixed.
                  The Xanthochroi have fair skins, blue eyes and light hair ; the others have dark
                  skins, eyes and hair, and are of a slighter frame. Together they constitute what
                  were once called the Caucasian races. The Melanochroi are not considered by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">Huxley</name> to be one of the primitive modifications of mankind, but rather
                  to be the result of the admixture of the Xanthochroi with the Australoid type,
                  next to be mentioned.</p>
                                <p>The third group is that of the Australoid type. Their hair is dark, generally
                  soft, never woolly. The eyes and skin are dark, the beard often well developed,
                  the nose broad and flat, the lips coarse, and jaws heavy. This race is believed to
                  form the basis of the people of the Indian peninsula, and of some of the hill
                  tribes of central India, to whom the name Dravidian has been given, and by its
                  admixture with the Melanochroic group to have given rise to the ordinary
                  population of the Indian provinces. It is also probable that the Australoid family
                  extends into south Arabia and Egypt.</p>
                                <p>The last group, the Negroid, is represented by the races to which has been given
                  the name of Negrito, from the small size of some of them. They are closely akin to
                  the negroes of South Africa, and possess the characteristic dark skins, woolly but
                  scanty beard and body hair, broad flat noses, and projecting lips of the African;
                  and are diffused over the Andaman Islands, a part of the Malay peninsula, the
                  Philippines, Papua, and some of the neighbouring islands. The Negritos appear to
                  be derived from a mixture of the true Negro with the Australoid type.</p>

                                <p>The distribution of the Mongolian group in Asia offers no particular difficulty.
                  There is complete present, and probably previous long-existing, geographical
                  continuity in the area over „ which they are found. There is also considerable
                  similarity of climate and other conditions throughout the northern half of Asia
                  which they occupy. The extension of modified forms of the Mongolian type over the
                  whole American continent may be mentioned as a remarkable circumstance connected
                  with this branch of the human race.</p>
                                <p>The Mongolians of the northern half of Asia are almost entirely nomadic, hunters
                  and shepherds or herdsmen. The least advanced of these, but far the most peaceful,
                  are those that occupy Siberia. Farther south the best-known tribes are <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchu">the Manchus</name>, <name type="people">the Mongols proper</name>, <name type="people">the Moguls</name>

                  Asia, and their irruptions into other parts of the continent and into Europe, have
                  produced very remarkable results in the history of the world.</p>
                                <p>The Chinese branch of the Mongolian family are a thoroughly settled people of
                  agriculturists and traders. They are partially Buddhist, and have a peculiar
                  monosyllabic, uninflected language, with writing consisting of symbols, which

                    Burmese</name> themselves), and that a cognate race occupies the Himalaya to the
                  eastern limits of Kashmir.</p>
                                <p>Some light has been thrown on the connexion between the Tibetan race and certain
                  tribes of central India, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bhil">the Bhils</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kol_people">Kols</name> ; and it seems more
                  probable that these tribes are the remnants of a Mongolian race which first
                  displaced a yet earlier Negroid population, and was then itself shouldered out by
                  a Caucasian irruption, than that they entered India by any of the northern
                  passages within historic times. Mongolian settlements have lately been found very
                  much farther extended into the border countries of north-west India than has been
                  hitherto recognized. <name type="people">The Mingals</name>, who, conjointly with

                                <p>The name of Aryan has been given to the races speaking languages derived from, or
                  akin to, the ancient form of Sanskrit, who now occupy the temperate zone extending
                  from the Mediterranean, across the highlands of Asia Minor, Persia and
                  Afghanistan, to <pb n="749" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0749.png"/> India.
                  The races speaking the languages akin to the ancient Assyrian, which are now
                  mainly represented by Arabic, have been called Semitic, and occupy the countries
                  south-west of Persia, including Syria and Arabia, besides extending into North
                  Africa. Though the languages of these races are very different they cannot be
                  regarded as physically distinct, and they are both without doubt branches of the
                  Melanochroi, modified by admixture with the neighbouring races, the Mongols, the
                  Australoids and the Xanthochroi.</p>
                                <p>The Aryans of India are probably the most settled and civilized of all Asiatic
                  races. This type is found in its purest form in the north and north-west, while
                  the mixed races and the population referred to the Australoid type predominate in
                  the peninsula and southern India. The spoken languages of northern India are very
                  various, differing one from another in the sort of degree that English differs
                  from German, though all are thoroughly Sanskritic in their vocables, but with an
                  absence of Sanskrit grammar that has given rise to considerable discussion. The
                  languages of the south are Dravidian, not Sanskritic. The letters of both classes
                  of languages, which also vary considerably, are all modifications of the ancient
                  Pali, and probably derived from the Dravidians, not from the Aryans. They are
                  written from left to right, exception being made of Urdu or Hindostani, the mixed
                  language of the Mahommedan conquerors of northern India, the character used for
                  writing which is the Persian. From the river Sutlej and the borders of the Sind
                  desert, as far as Burma and to Ceylon, the religion of the great bulk of the
                  people of India is Hindu or Brahminical, though the Mahommedans are often
                  numerous, and in some places even in a majority. West of the Sutlej the population
                  of Asia may be said to be wholly Mahommedan, with the exception of certain
                  relatively small areas in Asia Minor and Syria, where Christians predominate. The
                  language of the Punjab does not differ very materially from that of Upper India.
                  West of the Indus the dialects approach more to Persian, which language meets
                  Arabic and Turki west of the Tigris, and along the Turkoman desert and the
                  Caspian. Through the whole of this tract the letters are used which are common to
                  Persian, Arabic and Turkish, written from right to left.</p>

                                <p>Considerable progress has been made in the classification of the various races
                  which occupy the continent to the west of the great Mongolian region. The ancient

                  are recognized in the Aryan population, who may be found in great numbers and in
                  their purest form in the more inaccessible mountains and glens of the central
                  highlands. These <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tājik_people">Tajiks</name> (as they are
                  usually called) form the underlying population of Persia, Baluchistan, Afghanistan
                  and Badakshan, and their language (in the central districts of Asia) is found to
                  contain words of Aryan or Sanskrit derivation which are not known in Persian. They
                  have been for the most part dispossessed of their country by Turkish immigration
                  and conquests, but they still retain their original intellectual superiority over

                  small affinity with the Mongol element of Asia. They are the representatives of

                  who are found principally in the valleys of the Tian-shan and Altai mountains,
                  being unmistakably Turkish. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kipchaks">The Kipchaks</name> are only a <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyrgyz">Kirghiz</name> clan. The

                    Kirghiz</name> is Turki and their religion that of Mahomet. As a nomadic people

                  Buddhist and Mongolian people who originated in a confederacy of tribes dwelling
                  in Dzungaria, migrated to Siberia, and settled on the Lower Volga. From thence
                  they returned late in the 18th century to the reoccupation of their old ground in
                  Kulja under <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name>. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkmen_people">The Turkoman</name> is the
                  purest form of the Turk element, and his language is the purest form of the
                  Turkish tongue, which is represented at Constantinople by a comparatively mongrel,
                  or mixed, dialect. Ethnographers have traced a connexion between <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkmen_people">the

                  also been found in the mutual possession by these races of a ruddy skin, so that
                  as ethnographical inquiry advances <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turk</name> appears to
                  recede from his <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongolia">Mongolian</name> affinities and to approach <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caucasus">the Caucasian</name>. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name> and

                  usually termed the Mogul dynasty, although there can be no distinction traced
                  between the terms Mogul and Mongol. The general results of recent inquiry into the
                  ethnography of Afghanistan is to support the general correctness of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Walter_Bellew">Bellew</name>'s theories of the origin of the Afghan races. The claim of <name type="people">the Durani Afghan</name> to be a true Ben-i-Israel is certainly in
                  no way weakened by any recent investigation. The influence of Greek culture in
                  northern India is fully recognized, and the distribution of Greek colonies
                  previous to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name>'s time is
                  attested by practical knowledge of the districts they were said to occupy. The <hi rend="italic">habitat</hi> of <name type="people">the Nysaeans</name>, and the
                  identity of certain tribes of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kafiristan">Kafiristan</name> with the
                  descendants of these pre-Alexandrian colonists from the west, are also well

                  of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kafiristan">Kafiristan</name>. The ethnographical status of the mixed tribes of tho
                  mountains that lie between Chitral and the Peshawar plains has been fairly well

                                <p>The result of trans-border surveys to the north and west of India has been to
                  establish the important geographical fact that it is by two gateways only, one on
                  the north-west and one on the west of India, that the central Asiatic tides of
                  immigration have flowed into the peninsula. The Kabul valley indicates the
                  north-western entrance, and Makran indicates that on the west. By the Kabul valley
                  route, which includes at its head the group of passes across the Hindu Kush which
                  extend from the Khawak to the Kaoshan, all those central Asian hordes, be they
                    <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saka">Sacae</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuezhi">Yue-chi</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jat_people">Jats</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goths">Goths</name> or <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, who were
                  driven towards the rich plains of the south, entered the Punjab. Some of them
                  migrated from districts which belong to eastern Asia, but none of them penetrated
                  into India by eastern passes. Such tides as set towards the Himalaya broke against
                  their farther buttresses, leaving an interesting ethnographical flotsam in the
                  northern valleys ; but they never overflowed the Himalayan barrier. Later most of
                  the historic invasions of India from central Asia followed tho route which leads
                  directly from Kabul to Peshawar and Delhi.</p>
                                <p>By the western gates of Makran prehistoric irruptions from Mesopotamia broke into
                  the plains of Lower Sind, and either passed on towards the central provinces of
                  India or were absorbed in the highlands south of Kalat. In later centuries <name type="people">the Arabs</name> from the west reached the valley of the Indus by
                  their western route, and there established a dynasty which lasted for 300 years.
                  The identification of existing peoples with the various Scythic, Persian and Arab
                  races who have passed from High Asia into the Indian borderland, has opened up a
                  vast field of ethnographical inquiry which has hardly yet found adequate workers
                  for its investigation. To such fields may be added the yet more complicated
                  problems of those reflex waves which flowed backwards from India into the border
                  highlands.</p>

                  that Asiatics have not the same sentiment of independence and freedom as
                  Europeans. Individuals are thought of as members of a family, state or religion,
                  rather than as entities with a destiny and rights of their own. This leads to
                  autocracy in politics, fatalism in religion and conservatism in both. Hence, too,
                  Asiatic history has large and simple outlines. Though longer chronologically than
                  the annals of Europe, it is less eventful, less diversified and offers fewer
                  personalities of interest. But the same conditions which render individual
                  eminence difficult procure for it when once attained a more ready recognition, and
                  the conquerors and prophets of Asia have had more power and authority than their
                  parallels in Europe. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genghis_Khan">Jenghiz Khan</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timur">Timur</name> covered more

                                <p>3. Attention has often been called to the religious character of Asia. Not only
                  the great religions of the world—Buddhism, Christianity, Islam—but those of
                  secondary importance, such as Judaism, Parseeism, Taoism, are all Asiatic. No
                  European race left to itself has developed anything more than an unsystematic
                  paganism. It is true that Greek philosophy advanced far beyond this stage, but it
                  produced nothing sufficiently popular to be called a religion. <pb n="750" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0750.png"/> On the other hand Christianity,
                  though Asiatic in its origin and essential ideas, has to a large extent taken its
                  present form on European soil, and some of its most important manifestations—
                  notably <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman
                  Church</name>—are European reconstructions in which little of the Asiatic element
                  remains. Christianity has made little way farther east than <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia">Asia Minor</name>. Modern missions
                  have made no great conquests there, and in earlier times the Nestorians and
                  Jacobites who penetrated to central Asia, China and India, received respectful
                  hearing, but never had anything like the success which attended Buddhism and
                  Islam. Yet Buddhism has never made much impression west of India, and Islam is
                  clearly repugnant to Europeans, for even when under Moslem rule (as in Turkey)
                  they refuse to accept it in a far larger proportion than did <name type="people">the Hindus</name> in similar circumstances. Hence there is clearly a
                  deep-seated difference between the religious feelings of the two continents.</p>
                                <p>Since Asiatic records go back much farther than those of Europe, it is natural
                  that Asia should be thought the birthplace of civilization. But this originality
                  cannot be absolute, for, whatever may have been the relations of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and
                  the Aryans, the latter brought civilization to India from the west, and it is not
                  always clear whether similarity of government and institutions is the result of
                  borrowing or of parallel development. Both in Europe and in Asia small feudal or
                  aristocratic states tended to consolidate themselves into monarchies, but whereas
                  in Europe from the early days of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> onwards royalty has
                  often been driven out and replaced temporarily or permanently by popular
                  government, this change seems not to occur in Asia, where revolution means only a
                  change of dynasty. The few cases where the government is not monarchical, as <name type="place">Arabia</name>, seem to represent the persistence of very ancient
                  conditions.</p>
                                <p>The contemplation of Asia suggests that progress is most rapid when accompanied
                  by the migration of races or the transplantation of ideas and institutions. Thus
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> excelled the Eastern countries from whom she may have derived her
                  civilization, and Buddhism had a far more brilliant career outside India than in
                  it.</p>

                                <p>4. In many parts of southern Asia are found semi-barbarous races representing the
                  earliest known stratum of population, such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vedda_people">the Veddahs</name> of Ceylon, and
                  various tribes in China and the Malay Archipelago. Some of them offer analogies to
                  the Australians. This connexion, if true, must be very ancient, since it
                  apparently goes back to a time when the distribution of land and water was other
                  than at present. In northern Asia are found other aborigines, such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ainu_people">the Ainus</name> of
                  Japan and the so-called hyperborean races (<name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chukchi_people">Chukchis</name>, etc.), but no
                  materials are at present forthcoming for their history. There is some record of
                  the migrations of the later races superimposed on these aborigines. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">The
                    Chinese</name> came from the west, though how far west is unknown : <name type="people">the Hindus</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people">Persians</name> from the
                  north-west: <name type="people">the Burmese</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thai_people">the Siamese</name> from the north.
                  We do not know if <name type="people">the Mongols</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name>, etc., had any
                  earlier home than central Asia, but their extensive movements from that region are
                  historical.</p>
                                <p>The antiquity of Asiatic history is often exaggerated. With the exception of
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name>
                  and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>,
                  we can hardly even conjecture what was the condition of this continent much before
                  1500 B.C. At that period <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> were
                  advancing along the Hwang-ho, and the Aryans were entering India from the
                  northwest. Both were in conflict with earlier races. The influence of Babylonian
                  civilization was probably widespread. Some connexion between <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and China is
                  generally admitted, and all Indian alphabets seem traceable to a Semitic original
                  borrowed in the course of commerce from the Persian Gulf. Apart from European
                  conquests, the internal history of Asia in the last 2000 years is the result of
                  the interaction of four main influences: <list>
                                        <item>(a) Chinese,</item>
                                        <item>(b) Indian,</item>
                                        <item>(c) Mahommedan,</item>
                                        <item>(d) Central Asian</item>
                                    </list>. Of these the first three represent different types of civilization : the
                  fourth has little originality, but has been of great importance in affecting the
                  distribution of races and political power.</p>
                                <p>(a) China has moulded the civilization of the eastern mainland and Japan, without
                  much affecting the Malay Archipelago. In the sphere of direct influence fall
                  Korea, Japan and Annam ; in the outer sphere are Mongolia, Tibet, Siam, Cambodia
                  and Burma, where Indian and Chinese influence are combined, the Indian being often
                  the stronger. These countries, except Japan, have all been at some time at least
                  nominal tributaries of China. Where Chinese influence had full play it introduced
                  Confucianism, a special style in art and the Chinese system of writing. After the
                  Christian era it was accompanied by Chinese Buddhism. The cumbrous Chinese script
                  maintains itself in the Far East, but has not advanced west of China proper and
                  Annam.</p>
                                <p>(b) Indian influence may be defined as Buddhism, if it is understood that
                  Buddhism is not at all periods clearly distinguishable from Hinduism. Its sphere
                  includes Indo-China, much of the Malay Archipelago, Tibet and Mongolia. Moreover,
                  China and Japan themselves may be said to fall within this sphere, in view of the
                  part which Buddhism has played in their development. The Buddhist influence is not
                  merely religious, for it is always accompanied by Indian art and literature, and
                  often by an Indian alphabet. Much of this art is Greek in origin, being derived
                  from the Perso-Greek states on the north-west frontiers of India. Indian alphabets
                  have spread to Tibet, Cambodia, Java and Korea. The history of Indian civilization
                  in Indo-China and the Archipelago is still obscure, in spite of the existence of
                  gigantic ruins, but it would appear that in some parts at least two periods must
                  be distinguished, first the introduction of Hinduism (or mixed Hinduism and
                  Buddhism), perhaps under Indian princes, and secondly a later and more purely
                  ecclesiastical introduction of Sinhalese Buddhism, with its literature and
                  art.</p>
                                <p>(c) Mahommedanism or Islam is perhaps the greatest transforming force which the
                  world has seen. It has profoundly affected and to a large extent subjugated all
                  western Asia including India, all eastern and northern Africa as well as Spain,
                  and all eastern Europe. Its open advocacy of force attracts warlike races, and the
                  intensity of its influence is increased by the fusion of secular and religious
                  power, so that <name type="institution">the Moslem Church</name> is a Moslem state
                  characterized by slavery, polygamy, and, subject to the autocracy of the ruler, by
                  the theoretical equality of Moslems, who in political status are superior to non-
                  Moslems. Thus, whenever the population of a Moslem country is of mixed belief, a
                  ruling caste of Moslems is formed, as in Turkey at the present day and India under
                  the Moguls. Islam is paramount in Turkey, Persia, Arabia and Afghanistan. India is
                  the dividing line : Islam is strong in northern and central India, weaker in the
                  south. But only one-fifth of the whole population is Moslem. Beyond India it has
                  spread to Malacca and the Malay Archipelago, where it overwhelmed Hindu
                  civilization, and reached the southern Philippines. But it made no progress in
                  Indo-China or Japan ; and though there is a large Moslem population in China the
                  Chinese influence has been stronger, for alone of all Asiatics <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> have
                  succeeded in forcing Islam to accept the ordinary limitations of a religion and to
                  take its place as a creed parallel to Buddbism or any other.</p>
                                <p>Even more than Buddhism Islam has carried with it a special style of art and
                  civilization. It is usually accompanied by the use of the Arabic alphabet, and in
                  the languages of Moslem nations (notably Turkish, Persian, Hindustani and Malay) a
                  large proportion of the vocabulary is borrowed from Arabic. Hindi and Hindustani,
                  two forms of the same language as spoken by Hindus and Mahommedans respectively,
                  are a curious example of how deeply religion may affect culture.</p>
                                <p>(d) The great part which central Asian tribes have played in history is obscured
                  by the absence of any common name for them. Linguistically they can be divided
                  into several groups such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name>, <name type="people">Mongols</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, but they were from time to
                  time united into states representing more than one group, and their armies were
                  recruited, like the Janissaries, from all the military races in the neighbourhood.
                  Soon after the Christian era central Asia began to boil over, and at least seven
                  great invasions and more or less complete conquests can be ascribed to these
                  tribes without counting minor movements. <list>

                  Persia.</p>
                                <p>These tribes have a genius for warfare rather than for government, art or
                  literature, and with few exceptions (e.g. <name type="people">the Moguls</name> in
                  India) have proved poor administrators. Apart from conquest their most important
                  function has been to keep up communications in central Asia, and to transport
                  religions and civilizations from one region to another. Thus they are mainly
                  responsible for the introduction of Islam with its Arabic or Persian civilization
                  into India and Europe, and in earlier times their movements facilitated the
                  infiltration of Graeco-Bactrian civilization into India besides maintaining
                  communication between China and the West.</p>

                  Asiatic history, but in early times the centre of activity and culture lay farther
                  west in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>. These ancient states

                  but lend themselves to discussion rather than to a summary of admitted facts. In
                  the early history of southwestern Asia <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the Semites</name> form the most
                  important ethnic group, which is primarily linguistic but also shares other
                  remarkable characteristics. Two of the greatest religions of the world,
                  Christianity and Islam, are Semitic in origin, as well as Judaism. In politics
                  these races have been less successful in modern times, but the Semitic states of
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name>
                  and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>
                  were once the principal centres for the development and distribution of
                  civilization. It is generally agreed that this civilization can be traced back to
                  an earlier race, the Sumero-Akkadians, whose language seems allied to the
                  agglutinative idioms of central Asia. If this ancient civilized race was really
                  allied to the ancestors of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, it is a
                  remarkable instance of how civilization thrives best by being transplanted at a
                  certain period of growth. Still less is known of the early non-Aryan races of
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia">Asia Minor</name>
                  such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hittites">the
                    Hittites</name> and <name type="people">Alorodians</name>. One hypothesis
                  supposes that the shores of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea">the Mediterranean</name>
                  were originally inhabited by a homogeneous race neither Aryan nor Semitic.</p>
                                <p>The earliest Sumerian records seem to be anterior to 4000 B.C. Shortly after that
                  period <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> was invaded by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the Semites</name>, who became the
                  ruling race. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">The city
                    of Babylon</name> came to the fore as metropolis about 2285 B.C. under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammurabi">Khammurabi</name>.
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name> was
                  an offshoot of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> lying to the north-west, and apparently colonized before the
                  second millennium. While using the same language as the Babylonians, the Assyrians
                  had an individuality which showed itself in art and religion. In the 9th and 8th
                  centuries B.C. they became the chief power within their sphere and the suzerain of
                  their parent <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">Babylon</name>. But they succumbed before the advance of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the

                  back much beyond 1000 B.C. It is generally admitted that there was some connexion
                  between the ancient civilizations of China and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name>, but its precise
                  nature is still uncertain. It is clear, however, that <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> came from
                  the west, and entered their present territory along the course of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yellow_River">the Hwang-ho</name>
                  at an unknown period, possibly about 3000 B.C. In early historical times China
                  consisted of a shifting confederacy of feudal states, but about 220 B.C. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Qin_Dynasty">the state of
                    Tsin or Chin</name> (whence the name China) came into prominence, and succeeded
                  in forming a homogeneous empire, which advanced considerably towards the south.
                  The subsequent history of China is mainly a record of struggles with various
                  tribes, commonly, but not very correctly, called <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tatars">Tatars</name>. The empire was
                  frequently broken up by successful incursions, or divided between rival dynasties,
                  but at least twice became a great Asiatic power : under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Han_Dynasty">the Han dynasty</name> (about 200
                  B.C-A.D. 220), and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tang_Dynasty">the T'ang</name> (A.D. 618-906).
                  The dominions of the latter extended across central Asia to northern India, but
                  were dismembered by the attacks of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khitan_people">the Kitans</name>, whence the
                  name <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathay">Cathay</name>.
                  China proper, minus these external provinces, was again united under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song_Dynasty">the Sung
                    dynasty</name> (960-1127), but split into the northern (Tatar) and southern
                  (Chinese) kingdoms. In the 13th century arose <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongol_Empire">the Mongol power</name>, and
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kublai_Khan">Kublai
                    Khan</name> conquered China. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongol_Empire">The Mongol dynasty</name> lasted
                  less than a century, but <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ming_Dynasty">the Ming</name>, the native
                  Chinese dynasty which succeeded it, reigned for nearly 300 years and despatched
                  expeditions which reached India, Ceylon and East Africa. In 1644 <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ming_Dynasty">the
                    Ming</name> succumbed to the attacks of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchu">the Manchus</name>, a northern tribe
                  who captured <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beijing">Peking</name> and founded the present imperial house.</p>
                                <p>Until the advent of Europeans, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> were always
                  in contact with inferior races. Whether they expanded at the expense of weak
                  aboriginal tribes or were conquered by more robust invaders, Chinese civilization
                  prevailed and assimilated alike the conquered and the conquerors. It is largely to
                  this that we must ascribe the national conservatism and contempt for foreigners.
                  The spirit of the Chinese polity is self-contained, anti-military and
                  anti-sacerdotal. Rank is nominally determined by merit, as tested by competitive
                  examinations. Society is conceived as regulated by mutual obligations, of which
                  the duties of parents and children are the most important. The emperor is head of
                  the state and the high priest, who sacrifices to Heaven on behalf of his people,
                  but he can be deposed, and no divine right is inherent in certain families as in
                  Japan and Turkey. On the contrary there have been 20 dynasties since the Christian
                  era.</p>
                                <p>The most conspicuous figure in Chinese literature is <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confucius">Confucius</name> (551—475 B.C).
                  Though he laid no claim to originality and merely sought to collect and
                  systematize the traditions of antiquity, his influence in the Far East has been
                  unbounded, and he must be pronounced one of the most powerful advocates of peace
                  and humanity that have ever existed. Confucianism is an ethical rather than a
                  religious system, and hence was able to co-exist, though not on very friendly
                  terms, with Buddhism, which reached China about the 1st century A.D. and was the
                  chief source of Chinese religious ideas, except the older ancestor worship. But
                  they are not a religious people, and like many Europeans regard the church as a
                  department of the state.</p>

                  traditions of an older but unknown population, but was invaded in prehistoric
                  times by a race akin to <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Koreans">the Koreans</name>, which was possibly
                  mingled with <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malays_(ethnic_group)">Malay</name> elements
                  after occupying the southern part of the islands. Authentic history does not begin
                  till about the 6th century A.D., when Chinese civilization and Buddhism were
                  introduced. The government was originally autocratic, but as early as the 7th
                  century the most characteristic feature of Japanese politics— the power of great
                  families who overshadowed the throne— makes its appearance. We hear first of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fujiwara_clan">the Fujiwara
                    family</name>, and then of the rivalry between the houses of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taira_clan">Taira</name> and
                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minamoto_clan">Minamoto</name>. The latter prevailed, and in 1192 established the dual system
                  of government under which the emperor or Mikado ruled only in name, and the real
                  power was in the hands of a hereditary military chief called Shogun. Japan has
                  never been invaded in historical times, but an attempt made by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kublai_Khan">Kublai Khan</name> to conquer it
                  was successfully repulsed. The chief power then passed to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashikaga_clan">the Ashikaga dynasty</name> of
                  Shoguns, who retained it for about 200 years and were distinguished for their
                  patronage of the arts. The second half of the 16th century was a period of ferment
                  and anarchy, marked by the arrival of the Portuguese <pb n="752" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0752.png"/> and the rise of some remarkable
                  adventurers, one of whom, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi">Hideyoshi</name>, conquered
                  Korea and apparently meditated the invasion of China. His plans were interrupted
                  by his death, and his successor, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Ieyasu</name>, who shaped the
                  social and political life of Japan for nearly 300 years (1603-1868), definitely
                  decided on a policy of seclusion and isolation. All ideas of external conquest
                  were abandoned, Christianity was forbidden, and Japan closed to foreigners, only
                  the Dutch being allowed a strictly limited commerce. In 1854-1859 the Christian
                  powers, beginning with the United States, successfully asserted their right to
                  trade with Japan. The influx of new ideas provoked civil war, in which the already
                  decadent Shogunate was abolished and the authority of the Mikado restored.
                  Recognizing that their only chance of competing with Europeans was to fight them
                  with their own weapons, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the Japanese</name> set
                  themselves deliberately to assimilate the material civilization and to some extent
                  the institutions of Europe, such as constitutional government. Their progress and
                  success are without parallel. In 1895 they defeated <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> and ten
                  years later <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russians">the
                    Russians</name>. Their exceptional status among Asiatic nations has been
                  recognized by treaties which, contrary to the general practice in non- Christian
                  countries, place all foreigners in Japan under Japanese law.</p>
                                <p>This sudden development of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the Japanese</name> is perhaps
                  the most important event of the second half of the 19th century, since it marks
                  the rise of an Asiatic power capable of competing with Europe on equal terms.
                  Their history is so different from that of the rest of Asia that it is not
                  surprising if the result is different. The nation hardly came into existence till
                  China and India had passed their prime, and remained secluded and free from the
                  continual struggle against barbarian invaders, which drained the energies of its
                  neighbours. It was left untouched by Mahommedanism, and for an unprecedentedly
                  long period kept Europeans at bay without wasting its strength in hostilities. The
                  military spirit was evolved, not in raids and massacres of the usual Asiatic type
                  which create little but intense racial hatred, but in feuds between families and
                  factions of the same race, which restrained ferocity and tended to create a temper
                  like that of the feudal chivalry of Europe. On the other hand it is noticeable
                  that <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the
                    Japanese</name> have little which is original in the way of religion, literature
                  or philosophy. Unlike <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> and <name type="people">Indians</name>, they have hitherto not had the smallest influence
                  on the intellectual development of Asia, and though they have in the past
                  sometimes shown themselves intensely nationalist and conservative, they have,
                  compared with India and China, so little which is really their own that their
                  assimilation of foreign ideas is explicable.</p>

                  well as Chinese writing. The country was at most periods independent though
                  nominally tributary to China. In the 16th century <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the Japanese</name> occupied

                  claims to suzerainty. In 1895 Korea was declared independent.</p>

                                <p>—The population of India comprises at least three strata: firstly, uncivilized
                  aborigines, such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kol_people">the Kols</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santals">Santhals</name>, and
                  secondly, the Dravidians (<name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tamil_people">Tamils</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kannadiga">Kanarese</name>,
                  etc.), who perhaps represent the earliest northern invaders, and appear to have
                  attained some degree of culture on their own account. The most recent authorities
                  are of opinion that the Kolarians and Dravidians represent a single physical type;
                  but, whatever the historical explanation may be, they certainly have different
                  languages and show different stages of civilization. In prehistoric times they
                  were spread over the whole of India, but were driven to the centre and south of
                  the peninsula by the third stratum of Aryans, and perhaps also by invasions of
                  so-called Mongolian races from the north-west. No historical record has been
                  preserved of these latter, but they appear to have profoundly affected the
                  population of Bengal, which is believed to be Mongolo- Dravidian in composition.
                  The Aryans appear to have been settled to the north of the Hindu Kush, and to have
                  migrated south-eastwards about 1500 B.C. Their original home has been a subject of
                  much discussion, but the view now prevalent is that they arose in southern Russia
                  or Asia Minor, whence a section spread eastwards and divided into two closely
                  related branches— the Hindus and Iranians. There were probably two successive
                  Aryan immigrations, and the tradition of a struggle between them may be preserved

                  B.C. settled states had been formed in the Ganges valley. They were absolute
                  monarchies, but the power of the king was tempered by the extraordinary influence
                  possessed by the hereditary sacerdotal class or Brahmans. The position of this
                  class, which has remained till the present day, is connected with the institution
                  of caste, a division of the population into groups founded partly on racial
                  distinctions. The peaceful progress of Brahmanism was hindered by the doctrine of
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gautama_Buddha">the Indian
                    prince Gotama, called the Buddha,</name> which grew into one of the greatest
                  religions of the world. For many centuries the culture and development of <name type="people">the Hindus</name> depended mainly on the interaction of the old
                  Brahmanical religion and Buddhism. The latter was finally absorbed, and
                  disappeared in India itself, but has spread Indian influence over the whole of
                  eastern Asia, where it still flourishes.</p>
                                <p>In 326 B.C. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name> invaded

                    Punjab</name>. The immediate result was small, but the establishment of
                  Perso-Greek kingdoms in central Asia had a powerful influence on Indian art and
                  culture. It may also have helped to familiarize the Hindu mind with the idea of an
                  empire, which appeared among them later than in other Asiatic countries. The first
                  empire, called <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maurya_Empire">Maurya</name>, reached its greatest extent in the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashoka_the_Great">Asoka</name> (264-227 B.C.),
                  who ruled from Afghanistan to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chennai">Madras</name>. He was a zealous
                  Buddhist and gave the first example of a missionary religion, for by his exertions
                  the faith was spread over all India and Ceylon. No Hindu empires have lasted long,
                  and the Maurya dominions broke up fifty years after his death.</p>
                                <p>In the next period (c. 150 B.C.-A.D. 300) India was invaded from the north by
                  tribes partly of Parthian and partly of Turki (<name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuezhi">Yue-chi</name>, etc.) origin. Owing to
                  the absence of dated records, the chronology of these invasions has not yet been
                  set beyond dispute, but the most important was that of <name type="people">the
                    Kushans</name>, whose king <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kanishka">Kanishka</name> founded a state which
                  comprised northern India and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kashmir">Kashmir</name>. They were Buddhists,
                  and it is probable that the Mahāyāna or northern form of Buddhism was due to an
                  amalgamation of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gautama_Buddha">Gotama</name>'s doctrines with
                  the ideas (largely Greek and Persian) which they brought with them. Much of
                  Sivaism has probably the same origin. Another native empire, known as <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gupta_Empire">Gupta</name>,
                  rose on the ruins of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kushan_Empire">the Kushan kingdom</name>, and
                  embraced nearly the whole peninsula, but it broke up in the 5th century, partly
                  owing to the attacks of new northern invaders, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">the Huns</name>. <name type="institution">The Malava dynasty</name> maintained Hindu civilization in the 6th century, and
                  from 606 to 646 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harsha">Harsha</name> established a brief but brilliant empire in the north with its
                  capital at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kannauj">Kanauj</name>. This epoch is marked by the renaissance of Sanskrit literature
                  and the gradual revival of Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism. But after <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harsha">Harsha</name> Hindu
                  history is lost in a maze of small and transitory states, incapable of resisting
                  the ever advancing Mahommedan peril. As early as 712 <name type="people">the
                    Arabs</name> conquered Sind, and by the end of the 11th century the whole of
                  northern India was in Moslem hands. Two periods may be distinguished, namely the
                  Turki (1200-1526) and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mughal_Empire">the Mogul empire</name>. The
                  former comprised several dynasties of mixed Turki and Iranian race, but was
                  wanting in coherency. In the neighbourhood of the Moslem capitals, Islam spread
                  rapidly, but in such districts as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rajputana">Rajputana</name> and specially <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vijayanagara">Vijayanagar</name>

                  civilization and religion maintained themselves.</p>
                                <p>In 1526 <name type="people">the Moguls</name> descended on India from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transoxiana">Transoxiana</name>

                  south, but the empire which they founded in the north was for about two centuries,

                  of the French and English, continued to increase. Amidst such confusion the
                  authority of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mughal_Empire">the Mogul empire</name> rapidly
                  disappeared, but it lasted as a name till the Mutiny (1857).</p>
                                <p>Indian history until Mahommedan times is marked by the unusual prominence of
                  religious ideas, and is a record of intellectual development rather than of
                  political events. Whatever national unity the Hindu peoples possessed came from
                  the persistent and penetrating influence of the Brahman caste. Kings held a
                  secondary position, and were generally regarded as adventitious tyrants, rather
                  than as the heads and representatives of the nation. Even the great dynasties have
                  left few traces, and it is with difficulty that the patient historian disinters
                  the minor kingdoms from obscurity, but Indian religion, literature and art have
                  influenced all Asia from Persia to Japan.</p>

                  somewhere in central Asia. The religion was remodelled by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoroaster">Zoroaster</name>, who seems to be a
                  historical character and to have lived about the 7th century B.C. About the same
                  time they shook off the domination of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>. From the 6th century
                  onwards their empire, then known as Median, began to expand at the expense of the

                  indicate merely the pre-eminence of a particular tribe and not conquest by another

                  when at its maximum, extended from the Oxus and Indus in the east to Thrace in the
                  west and Egypt in the south, but fell before Greece, after lasting for rather more
                  than 200 years. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I_of_Persia">Darius</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I_of_Persia">Xerxes</name>

                  329. But the greater part of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the empire</name> continued
                  to exist under new masters, the Seleucids, as a Hellenistic power which was of
                  great importance for the dissemination of Greek culture in the East. Bactria soon
                  became independent under an Indo- Greek dynasty, and the blending of Greek,
                  Persian, central Asiatic and Hindu influences had an important effect on the art
                  and religion of India, and through India on all eastern Asia. About the same
                  period (250 B.C.-A.D. 227) <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arsacid_Empire">the Parthian empire</name>
                  arose under the Arsacids in Khorasan and the adjacent districts. <name type="people">The Parthians</name> appear to have been a Turanian tribe who had
                  adopted many Persian customs. They successfully withstood the Romans, and at one
                  time their power extended from India to Syria. They succumbed to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sassanid_Empire">the Persian
                    dynasty of the Sassanids</name>, who ruled successfully for about four
                  centuries, established the Zoroastrian faith as their state religion, and
                  maintained a creditable conflict with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire">the East Roman empire</name>.
                  But in the 7th century they were defeated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraclius">Heraclius</name>, and shortly
                  afterwards were annihilated before the first impetus of the Mahommedan conquest,
                  which established Islam in Persia and the neighbouring lands, sweeping away old
                  civilizations and boundaries. During the greater part of the Mahommedan period
                  Persia has been ruled by troubled and short-lived dynasties. It attained a certain
                  dignity and unity under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbas_I_of_Persia">Abbas Shah</name>
                  (1585-1628), but in later times was distracted and disorganized by Afghan
                  invasions. The present dynasty, which is of Turkoman origin, dates from 1789.</p>
                                <p>The achievements of the Persians in art, literature and religion are by no means
                  contemptible, but somewhat mixed and cosmopolitan. Owing to its position, the
                  Persian state, when it from time to time became a conquering empire, overlapped
                  Asia Minor, Babylon and India, and hence acted as an intermediary for transmitting
                  art and ideas, sending for instance Greek sculpture to India and the cult of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mithra">Mithra</name> to western
                  Europe. It is perhaps on account of this intermediate flavour that the literature
                  of Persia—for instance the adaptations of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omar_Khayyám">Omar Khayyam</name>— is more
                  appreciated in Europe than that of other Oriental nations. On the other hand, the
                  wars between Persia and Greece were recognized both at the time and afterwards as
                  a struggle between Europe and Asia; the fact that both combatants were Aryans was
                  not felt, and has no importance compared to the difference of continent.</p>

                  qualities they have been distinguished from the earliest times by a species of
                  commensalism, or power of living among other nations without becoming either
                  socially merged or politically distinct. Their traditional history represents them
                  as migrating to the borders of Egypt and living there for some centuries. After
                  the exodus, which perhaps took place about 1300 B.C., they moved northwards again
                  and founded a state of modest dimensions, which attained a short-lived unity under

                  were allowed to return to Palestine in 538. Their institutions and ideas were
                  probably considerably modified during this period. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">Babylon</name> long continued to be a

                  for about six centuries in partial independence under Persian, Egyptian, Syrian
                  and Roman rule, often showing an aggressively heroic attachment to its national
                  customs, which brought it into collision with its suzerains, until the temple was
                  destroyed by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Titus">Titus</name> in A.D. 70, and the country laid waste in the succeeding years.
                  But long before this period the Jews of the Dispersion had become as important as
                  the inhabitants of Palestine. From choice or compulsion large numbers settled in
                  Egypt in the time of the Ptolemies, and added an appreciable element to
                  Alexandrine culture, while gradual voluntary emigration established Jewish
                  communities in Syria, Asia Minor, Greece and Italy, who facilitated the first
                  spread of Christianity. In spite of chronic unpopularity and recurring
                  persecutions they have spread over nearly all Europe. At the end of the 15th
                  century they were expelled from Spain and many of the exiles moved eastwards. At
                  present the largest numbers are to be found in the eastern parts of Europe. It is
                  remarkable that though <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jew">the Jews</name> live in relative peace with Asiatics, the great majority of

                  ethnological data. The language and writing of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the Semites</name> who, at an unknown
                  period, settled in what is now Abyssinia, show affinities with those of South
                  Arabia, and these <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the Semites</name> may have been immigrants into Africa from that region. It is
                  plain from early Moslem literature that Persian, Christian and especially Jewish
                  ideas had penetrated into Arabia.</p>
                                <p>With the rise of Mahommedanism occurred a sudden effervescence of <name type="people">the Arabs</name>, who during some centuries threatened to impose
                  not only their political authority but their civilization and new religion on the
                  whole known world. They successfully invaded India and central Asia in the east,
                  Spain and Morocco in the west. The Caliphate under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Umayyad_Caliphate">the Omayyads of

                    Bagdad</name>, became the principal power in the nearer East. It had not,
                  however, a sufficiently coherent organization for permanence; parts of it became
                  independent, <pb n="754" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0754.png"/> others
                  were first protected and then absorbed by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name>. The Arab rule
                  in Spain, which once threatened to overwhelm Europe and was turned back near <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tours">Tours</name> by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Martel">Charles
                    Martel</name>, was distinguished by its tolerance and civilization, and lingered
                  on till the 15th century.</p>
                                <p>The collapse of the political power of <name type="people">the Arabs</name> was
                  singularly complete. The Caliphate, though Arabian, was always geographically
                  outside Arabia, and on its fall Arabia remained as it was before Islam, isolated
                  and inaccessible. It is still one of the least known parts of the globe, and has
                  hardly any political link with the outside, for <name type="people">the
                    Arabs</name> of northern Africa form separate states. But in spite of this total
                  political collapse, Arabic religion and literature are still one of the greatest
                  forces working in the western half of Asia, in northern Africa and to some extent
                  in eastern Europe.</p>

                                <p>—This widely - scattered race has no political union and its distribution is a
                  puzzle for ethnography. At present it occupies the extremity of the Malay
                  Peninsula, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines and other islands of the Malay
                  Archipelago as well as Madagascar, while the inhabitants of most islands in the
                  South Seas, including New Zealand and Hawaii, speak languages which if not Malay
                  have at least undergone a strong Malay influence. It would seem from this
                  distribution that <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malays_(ethnic_group)">the Malays</name> are
                  not continental, but a seafaring race with exceptional powers of dispersal, who
                  have spread over the ocean from some island centre—perhaps Java. The latest
                  theory, however, is that there is a great linguistic group (which may or may not
                  prove to correspond to an ethnic unity) comprising the Mundā, Mōnkhmer, Malay,
                  Polynesian and Micronesian languages, and that the stream of immigration which
                  distributed them started from the extreme west. Three periods can be traced in the
                  history of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malays_(ethnic_group)">the Asiatic
                    Malays</name>. In the first (in which such tribes as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dayak_people">the Dyaks</name> have remained)
                  they were semi-barbarous. In the second, Hindu civilization reached the Malay
                  Peninsula, Java, Sumatra and other islands. The presence of Hindu ruins, as well
                  as of numerous Indian words and customs, testifies to the strength of this
                  influence. It was, however, superseded by Islam, which spread to the Malay
                  Archipelago and Peninsula before the 16th century. At the present time the Arabic
                  alphabet is used on the mainland, but Indian alphabets in Java, Sumatra, etc.</p>

                  escaped Islam, and though it is a nominal vassal of China, direct Chinese
                  influence has not been strong. The most striking feature is the religion, a
                  corrupt form of late Indian Buddhism, known as Lamaism, which, largely in
                  consequence of the favour shown by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genghis_Khan">Jenghiz Khan</name> and his

                                <p>18. Almost all Asiatic countries have a literature, but it is often not
                  indigenous and consists of foreign works, chiefly religious, read either in
                  translations or the original. Thus with the exception of a little folklore the
                  literature of Indo-China, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea and Manchuria is mainly Indian or
                  Chinese. The chief original literatures are Chinese, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic and
                  Persian. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">The
                    Japanese</name> have produced few books of importance, and their compositions
                  are chiefly remarkable as being lighter and more secular than is usual in Asia,
                  but the older Chinese works take high rank both for their merits and the effect
                  they have had. The extensive Sanskrit literature, which has reached in
                  translations China, Japan and Java, is chiefly theological and poetical, history
                  being conspicuously absent. India has also a considerable medieval and modern
                  literature in various languages. Pali, though only a form of Hindu literature, has
                  a separate history, for it died in India and was preserved in Ceylon, whence it
                  was imported to Burma and Siam as the language of religion. The Pali versions of
                  Buddha's discourses are among the most remarkable products of Asia. The
                  literatures of all Moslem peoples are largely inspired by Arabic, which has
                  produced a voluminous collection of works in prose and poetry. Persian, after
                  being itself transformed by Arabic, has in its turn largely influenced all west
                  Asiatic Moslem literature from Hindustani to Turkish.</p>
                                <p>If one excepts <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Testament">the Old
                    Testament</title>, which is a product of the extreme west of Asia, it is
                  remarkable how small has been the influence of Asiatic literature on Europe.
                  Though Greek and Slavonic almost ceased to be written languages under Turkishrule,
                  Europeans showed no disposition to replace them by Ottoman or Arabic
                  literature.</p>
                                <p>Without counting subdivisions, there would seem to be three main schools of art
                  in Asia at present—Chinese, Indian and Moslem. The first contains many original
                  elements. It is feeblest in architecture and strongest in the branches demanding
                  skill and care in a limited compass, such as painting, porcelain and enamel. It is
                  the main inspiration of Japanese art, which, however, shows great originality in
                  its treatment of borrowed themes. Both China and Japan have felt through Buddhism
                  the influence of Indian art, which contains at least two elements— one indigenous
                  and the other Greco-Persian. Unlike Chinese art it has a genius for architecture
                  and sculpture rather than painting. Mahommedan art is also largely architectural
                  and has affected <pb n="755" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0755.png"/> nearly
                  all Moslem countries. Except that the use of Arabic inscriptions is one of its
                  principal methods of decoration, it owes little to Arabia and much to Byzantium.
                  The Persian variety of this art is more ornate, and less averse to representations
                  of living beings. Both Moslem and Chinese art are closely connected with
                  calligraphy, but Hindus rarely use writing for ornament.</p>
                                <p>In both art and literature modern Asia is inferior to the past more conspicuously
                  than Europe.</p>
                                <p>As for science, astronomy was cultivated by the Babylonians at an early period,
                  and it is probably from them that a knowledge of the heavenly bodies and their
                  movements spread over Asia. Grammar and prosody were studied in India with a
                  marvellous accuracy and minuteness several centuries before <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus">Christ</name>. Mathematics were
                  cultivated by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name>, <name type="people">Indians</name> and <name type="people">Arabs</name>, but nearly all the sciences based on the observation of nature,
                  including medicine, have remained in a very backward condition. Much the same,
                  however, might have been said of Europe until two centuries ago, and the
                  scientific knowledge of <name type="people">the Arabs</name> under the earlier
                    <name type="institution">Caliphates</name> was equal or superior to that of any
                  of their contemporaries. Histories and accounts of travels have been composed both
                  in Arabic and Chinese.</p>

                                <p>19. It is only natural that Europe should have chiefly felt the influence of
                  western Asia. Though Europeans may be indebted to China for some mechanical
                  inventions, she was too distant to produce much direct effect, and the influence
                  of India has been mainly directed towards the East. The resemblances between
                  primitive Christianity and Buddhism appear to be coincidences, and though both
                  early Greek philosophy and later Alexandrine ideas suggest Indian affinities,
                  there is no clear connexion such as there is between certain aspects of Chinese
                  thought and India.</p>
                                <p>Any general statement as to the debt owed by early European civilizations to
                  western Asia would at present be premature, for though important discoveries have
                  been made in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">Crete</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> the best authorities are chary of positive conclusions as to

                  influence within <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea">the Aegean area</name> seems certain, and the theory that Greek writing and

                  been disproved, though the history of the alphabet is more complex than was
                  supposed.</p>
                                <p>In historic times Asia has attempted to assert her influence over Europe by a
                  series of invasions, most of which have been repulsed. Such were the Persian wars
                  of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name>, and perhaps one may add <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hannibal">Hannibal</name>'s invasion of Italy,
                  if <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage">the

                  Islam has twice obtained a footing in Europe, under <name type="people">the
                    Arabs</name> in Spain and under <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name> at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name>. The earlier Asiatic invasions were conducted by armies
                  operating at a distance from their bases, and had little result, for the soldiery
                  retired after a time (like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name> from
                  India), or more rarely (e.g. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulgarians">the Bulgarians</name>) settled down
                  without keeping up any connexion with Asia. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">The Turks</name>, and to some
                  extent <name type="people">the Arabs</name> in Spain, were successful because they
                  first conquered the parts of Asia and Africa adjoining Europe, so that the final
                  invaders were in touch with Asiatic settlements. Though <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name> have
                  profoundly affected the whole of eastern Europe, the result of their conquests has
                  been not so much to plant Asiatic culture in Europe as to arrest development
                  entirely, the countries under their rule remaining in much the same condition as
                  under the moribund <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine empire</name>.</p>
                                <p>In general, Europe has in historic times shown itself decidedly hostile to
                  Asiatic institutions and modes of thought. It is only of recent years that the
                  writings of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</name> and
                  the researches of many distinguished orientalists have awakened some interest in
                  Asiatic philosophy.</p>
                                <p>The influence of Asia on Africa has been considerable, and until the middle of
                  the 19th century greater than that of Europe. Some authorities hold that <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt">Egyptian</name>
                  civilization came from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name>, and that the
                  so-called Hamitic languages are older and less specialized members of the Semitic
                  family. The connexion between <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage">Carthage</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia">Phoenicia</name> is
                  more certain, and the ancient <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethiopian_Empire">Abyssinian kingdom</name> was
                  founded by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">Semites</name> from south Arabia. The traditions of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Somali_people">the Somalis</name> derive them
                  from the same region. The theory that the ruins in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mashonaland">Mashonaland</name> were built by
                  immigrants from south Arabia is now discredited, but there was certainly a
                  continuous stream of <name type="people">Arab</name> migration to East Africa
                  which probably began in pre-Moslem times and founded a series of cities on the
                  coast. The whole of the north of Africa from Egypt to Morocco has been
                  mahommedanized, and Mahommedan influence is general and fairly strong from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timbuktu">Timbuktu</name> to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lake_Chad">Lake Chad</name> and
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ouaddaï_Region">Wadai</name>. South of the equator, <name type="people">Arab</name> slave-dealers
                  penetrated from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zanzibar">Zanzibar</name> to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/African_Great_Lakes">the great lakes</name> and

                  power, though formidable, has disappeared without leaving any permanent
                  traces.</p>
                                <p>The relation to Asia of the pre-European civilizations of America is another of
                  those questions which admit of no definite answer at present, though many facts
                  support the theory that the semi-civilized inhabitants of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mexico">Mexico</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_America">Central America</name> crossed
                  from Asia by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bering_Strait">Bering Straits</name> and descended the west coast. Some authorities hold that

                    civilization</name> had no connexion with the north and was an entirely

                  languages of central and northern Asia.</p>

                                <p>20. European influence on Asia has been specially strong at two epochs, firstly
                  after the conquests of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander the
                  Great</name>, and secondly from the 16th century onwards. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name>'s
                  conquests resulted in the foundation of Perso-Greek kingdoms in Asia, which not
                  only hellenized their own area but influenced the art and religion of India and to
                  some extent of China. Then follows a long period in which eastern Europe was
                  mainly occupied in combating Asiatic invasions, and had little opportunity of
                  Europeanizing the East. Somewhat later the Crusades kept up communication with the
                  Levant, and established there the power of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Church</name>,
                  somewhat to the detriment of oriental Christianity, but intercourse with farther
                  Asia was limited to the voyages of a few travellers. Looking at eastern Europe and
                  western Asia only, one must say that Asiatic influences have on the whole
                  prevailed hitherto (though perhaps the tide is turning), for Islam is paramount in
                  this region and European culture at a low ebb. But the case is quite different if
                  one looks at the two continents as a whole, for improvement in means of
                  communication has brought about strange vicissitudes, and western Europe has
                  asserted her power in middle and eastern Asia.</p>
                                <p>In the 16th century a new era began with the discovery by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portuguese_people">the Portuguese</name> of the
                  route to India round <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cape_of_Good_Hope">the Cape</name>, and the
                  naval powers of Europe started one after another on careers of oriental conquest.
                  The movement was maritime and affected the nations in the extreme west of Europe
                  rather than those nearer Asia, who were under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Turkish yoke</name>. Also
                  the parts of Asia affected were chiefly India and the extreme East. The countries
                  west of India, being less exposed to naval invasion, remained comparatively
                  untouched. It will thus be seen that European (excluding Russian) power in Asia is
                  based almost entirely on improved navigation. There was no attempt to overwhelm
                  whole empires by pouring into them masses of troops, but commerce was combined
                  with territorial acquisition, and a continuity of European interest secured by the
                  presence of merchants and settlers. The course of oriental conquest followed the
                  events of European politics, and the possessions of European powers in the East
                  generally changed hands according to the fortunes of their masters at home. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portugal">Portugal</name> was
                  first on the scene, and in the 16th century established a considerable littoral
                  empire on the coasts of East Africa, India and China, fragments of which still
                  remain, especially <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goa">Goa</name>, where Portuguese influence on the natives was considerable. Before
                  the century was out <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people">the Dutch</name> appeared as the
                  successful rivals of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portuguese_people">the Portuguese</name>, but
                  the real struggle for supremacy in southern Asia took place between France and
                  England about 1740-1783. Both entered India as commercial companies, but the
                  disorganized condition of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mughal_Empire">the Mogul empire</name>
                  necessitated the use <pb n="756" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0756.png"/> of
                  military force to protect their interests, and allured them to conquest. The
                  companies gradually undertook the financial control of the districts where they
                  traded and were recognized by the natives as political powers. The ultimate
                  victory of England seems due less to any particular aptitude for dealing with
                  oriental problems than to a better command of the seas and to considerations of
                  European politics. At the end of the Napoleonic wars Portugal had Macao and Goa,
                  Holland Java, Sumatra and other islands, France some odds and ends in India, while
                  England emerged with Hong Kong, Singapore, Ceylon and a free hand in India. Guided
                  by such administrators as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warren_Hastings">Warren Hastings</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_India_Company">the East
                    India Company</name> had assumed more and more definitely the functions of
                  government for a great part of India. In 1809 its exclusive trading rights were
                  taken away by <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom">Parliament</name>, but its administrative status was thus made clearer, and
                  when after the mutiny of 1857 it was desirable to define British authority in
                  India there seemed nothing unnatural in declaring it to be a possession of the
                  crown.</p>
                                <p>Another category of European possessions in Asia comprises those acquired towards
                  the end of the 19th century, such as Indo-China (France), Burma and Wei-Hai-Wei
                  (Britain), and Kiao-Chow (Germany). Whereas the earlier conquests were mostly the
                  results of large half-conscious national movements working out their destinies in
                  the East, these later ones were annexations deliberately planned by European
                  cabinets. It seemed to be assumed that Asia was to be divided among the powers of
                  Europe, and each was anxious to get its share or more.</p>
                                <p>The advance of Russia in Asia is entirely different from that of the other
                  powers, since it has taken place by land and not by sea. Though the geographical
                  extent of Russian territory and influence is enormous, she has always moved along
                  the line of least resistance. She is a moderately strong empire lying to the north
                  of the great Moslem states, and having for neighbours a series of very weak
                  principalities or semi-civilized tribes. The conquest of Siberia and central Asia
                  presented no real difficulties: Persia and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> were left
                  on one side, and Russia was defeated as soon as she was opposed by a vigorous
                  power in the Far East. As the Russian possessions in Asia are continuous with
                  European Russia, it is only natural that they should have been russified far more
                  thoroughly than the British possessions have been anglicized.</p>
                                <p>There has been great difference of opinion as to the extent to which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name>'s conquests influenced Asia, and it is equally hard to say
                  what is the effect now being produced by Europe. Clearly such alterations as the
                  construction of railways in nearly all parts of the continent, and the
                  establishment of peace over formerly disturbed areas like India, are of enormous
                  importance, and must change the life of the people. But the mental constitution of
                  Asiatics is less easily modified than their institutions, and even Japan has
                  assimilated European methods rather than European ideas.</p>

                            </foreign>, from Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la">

                            </foreign>). In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom">the United Kingdom</name>, strictly speaking, <q>"city"</q> is an honorary title,
              officially applied to those towns which, in virtue of some pre-eminence (e.g. as
              episcopal sees, or great industrial centres), have by traditional usage or royal
              charter acquired the right to the designation. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom">the United Kingdom</name> the
              official style of <q>"city"</q> does not necessarily involve the possession of
              municipal power greater than those of the ordinary boroughs, nor indeed the possession
              of a corporation at all (e.g. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ely,_Cambridgeshire">Ely</name>). In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the United
                States</name> and the British colonies, on the other hand, the official application
              of the term <q>"city"</q> depends on the kind and extent of the municipal privileges
              possessed by the corporations, and charters are given raising towns to the rank of
              cities. Both in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name> the word is used to distinguish the older and central nucleus of
              some of the large towns, e.g. the <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                                <hi rend="italic">Cité</hi>
                            </foreign> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>,
              and the <q>"square mile"</q> under the jurisdiction of the lord mayor which is <q>
                                <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London">"the City of
                  London."</name>
                            </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In common usage, however, the word implies no more than a somewhat vague idea of size
              and dignity, and is loosely applied to any large centre of population. Thus while,
              technically, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London">"the
                City of London"</name>. is quite small, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> is yet properly described as
              the largest city in the world. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the United States</name> this use of
              the word is still more loose, and any town, whether technically a city or not, is
              usually so designated, with little regard to its actual size or importance.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from the above that the word <q>"city"</q> is incapable of any very clear
              and inclusive definition, and the attempt to show that historically it possesses a
              meaning that clearly differentiates it from <q>"town"</q> or <q>"borough"</q> has led
              to some controversy. As the translation of the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">πόλις</hi>
                            </foreign> or Latin <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">civitas</hi>
                            </foreign> it involves the ancient conception of the state or <q>"city-state,"</q>
              i.e. of the state as not too large to prevent its government through the body of the
              citizens assembled in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">agora</hi>
                            </foreign>, and is applied not to the place but to the whole body politic. From this
              conception both the word and its dignified connotation are without doubt historically
              derived. On the occupation of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul">Gaul</name> the Gallic states and tribes were
              called <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">civitates</hi>
                            </foreign> by the Romans, <pb n="401" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0401.png"/>
              and subsequently the name was confined to the chief towns of the various
              administrative districts. These were also the seats of the bishops. It is thus
              affirmed that in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> from the 5th to the 15th century the name <foreign xml:lang="la">

                    <div>
                        <p>The word <q>" civilization"</q> is an obvious derivative of the Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">civis</hi>

                            </foreign>, pertaining to a citizen. Etymologically speaking, then, it would be
              putting no undue strain upon the word to interpret it as having to do with the entire
              period of human progress since mankind attained sufficient intelligence and social
              unity to develop a system of government. But in practice <q>" civilization "</q> is
              usually interpreted in a somewhat narrower sense, as having application solely to the
              most recent and comparatively brief period of time that has elapsed since the most
              highly developed races of men have used systems of writing. This restricted usage is
              probably explicable, in part at least, by the fact that the word, though distinctly
              modern in origin, is nevertheless older than the interpretation of social evolution
              that now finds universal acceptance. Only very recently has it come to be understood
              that primitive societies vastly antedating the historical period had attained
              relatively high stages of development and fixity, socially and politically. Now that
              this is understood, however, nothing but an arbitrary and highly inconvenient
              restriction of meanings can prevent us from speaking of the citizens of these early
              societies as having attained certain stages of civilization. It will be convenient,
              then, in outlining the successive stages of human progress here, to include under the
              comprehensive term <q>" civilization "</q> those long earlier periods of <q>" savagery
                "</q> and <q>" barbarism "</q> as well as the more recent period of higher
              development to which the word <q>" civilization "</q> is sometimes restricted.</p>

                        <p>Adequate proof that civilization as we now know it is the result of a long, slow
              process of evolution was put forward not long after the middle of the 19th century by
              the students of palaeontology and of prehistoric archaeology. A recognition of the
              fact that primitive man used implements of chipped flint, of polished stone, and of
              the softer metals for successive ages, before he attained a decree of technical skill
              and knowledge that would enable him to smelt iron, led the Danish archaeologists to
              classify the stages of human progress under these captions: the Rough Stone Age ; the
              Age of Polished Stone ; the Age of Bronze ; and the Age of Iron. These terms acquired
              almost universal recognition, and they retain popularity as affording a very broad
              outline of the story of human progress. It is obviously desirable, however, to fill in
              the outlines of the story more in detail. To some extent it has been possible to do
              so, largely through the efforts of ethnologists who have studied the social conditions
              of existing races of savages. A recognition of the principle that, broadly speaking,
              progress has everywhere been achieved along the same lines and through the same
              sequence of changes, makes it possible to interpret the past history of the civilized
              races of to-day in the light of the present-day conditions of other races that are
              still existing under social and political conditions of a more primitive type. Such
              races as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Māori">the Maoris</name>
              and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">the American
                Indians</name> have furnished invaluable information to the student of social
              evolution; and the knowledge thus gained has been extended and fortified by the
              ever-expanding researches of the palaeontologist and archaeologist.</p>
                        <p>Thus it has become possible to present with some confidence a picture showing the
              successive stages of human development during the long dark period when our
              prehistoric ancestor was advancing along the toilsome and tortuous but on the whole
              always uprising path from lowest savagery to the stage of relative enlightenment at
              which we find him at the so-called <q>" dawnings of history."</q> That he was for long
              ages a savage before he attained sufficient culture to be termed, in modern
              phraseology, a barbarian, admits of no question. Equally little in doubt is it that
              other long ages of barbarism preceded the final ascent to civilization. The precise
              period of time covered by these successive <q>" Ages "</q> is of course only
              conjectural; but something like one hundred thousand years may perhaps be taken as a
              safe minimal estimate. At the beginning of this long period the most advanced race of
              men must be thought of as a promiscuous company of pre-troglodytic mammals, at least
              partially arboreal in habit, living on uncooked fruits and vegetables, and possessed
              of no arts and crafts whatever—not even of the knowledge of the rudest implement. At
              the end of the period, there emerges into the more or less clear light of history a
              large-brained being, living in houses of elaborate construction, supplying himself
              with divers luxuries through the aid of a multitude of elaborate handicrafts,
              associated with his fellows under the sway of highly organized governments, and
              satisfying aesthetic needs through the practice of pictorial and literary arts of a
              high order. How was this amazing transformation brought about?</p>

                        <p>If an answer can be found to that query, we shall have a clue to all human progress,
              not only during the prehistoric but also during the historic periods ; for we may well
              believe that recent progress has not departed from the scheme of development impressed
              on humanity during that long apprenticeship. Ethnologists believe that an answer can
              be found. They believe that the metamorphosis from beast-like savage to cultured
              civilian may be proximally explained (certain potentialities and attributes of the
              species being taken for granted) as the result of accumulated changes that found their
              initial impulses in a half-dozen or so of practical inventions. Stated thus, the
              explanation seems absurdly simple. Confessedly it supplies only a proximal, not a
              final, analysis of the forces impelling mankind along the pathway of progress. But it
              has the merit of tangibility; it presents certain highly important facts of human
              history vividly : and it furnishes a definite and fairly satisfactory basis for
              marking successive stages of incipient civilization.</p>
                        <p>In outlining the story of primitive man's advancement, upon such a basis, we may
              follow the scheme of one of the most philosophical of ethnologists, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lewis_H._Morgan">Lewis H.
                Morgan</name>, who made a provisional analysis of the prehistoric period that still
              remains among the most satisfactory attempts in this direction. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lewis_H._Morgan">Morgan</name> divides the entire
              epoch of man's progress from bestiality to civilization into six successive periods,
              which he names respectively the Older, Middle and Later periods of Savagery, and the
              Older, Middle and Later periods of Barbarism.</p>

              comprises the epoch when articulate speech was being developed. Our ancestors of this
              epoch inhabited a necessarily restricted tropical territory, and subsisted upon raw
              nuts and fruits. They had no knowledge of the uses of fire. All existing races of men
              had advanced beyond this condition before the opening of the historical period.</p>

                        <p>The Middle Period of Savagery began with a knowledge of the uses of fire. This
              wonderful discovery enabled the developing race to extend its habitat almost
              indefinitely, and to include flesh, and in particular fish, in its regular dietary.
              Man could now leave the forests, and wander along the shores and rivers, migrating to
              climates less enervating than those to which he had previously been confined.
              Doubtless he became an expert fisher, but he was as yet poorly equipped for hunting,
              being provided, probably, with no weapon more formidable than a crude hatchet and a
              roughly fashioned spear. The primitive races of Australia and Polynesia had not
              advanced beyond this middle status of savagery when they were discovered a few
              generations ago. It is obvious, then, that in dealing with the further progress of
              nascent civilization we have to do with certain favoured portions of the race, which
              sought out new territories and developed new capacities while many tribes of their
              quondam peers remained static and hence by comparison seemed to retrograde.</p>

                        <p>The next great epochal discovery, in virtue of which a portion of the race advanced
              to the Upper Status of Savagery, was that of the bow and arrow,—a truly wonderful
              implement. The possessor of this device could bring down the fleetest animal and could
              defend himself against the most predatory. He could provide himself not only with food
              but with materials for clothing and for tent-making, and thus could migrate at will
              back from the seas and large rivers, and far into inhospitable but invigorating
              temperate and sub-Arctic regions. The meat diet, now for the first time freely
              available, probably contributed, along with the stimulating climate, to increase the
              physical vigour and courage of this highest savage, thus urging him along the paths of
              progress. Nevertheless many tribes came thus far and no farther, as witness <name type="people">the Athapascans</name> of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hudson_Bay">the Hudson's Bay</name> Territory and

                        <p>We now come to the marvellous discovery that enabled our ancestor to make such
              advances upon the social conditions of his forbears as to entitle him, in the estimate
              of his remote descendants, to be considered as putting savagery behind him and as
              entering upon the Lower Status of Barbarism. The discovery in question had to do with
              the practice of the art of making pottery (see CERAMICS). Hitherto man had been
              possessed of no permanent utensils that could withstand the action of fire. He could
              not readily boil water except by some such cumbersome method as the dropping of heated
              stones into a wooden or skin receptacle. The effect upon his dietary of having at hand
              earthen vessels in which meat and herbs could be boiled over a fire must have been
              momentous. Various meats and many vegetables become highly palatable when boiled that
              are almost or quite inedible when merely roasted before a fire. Bones, sinews and even
              hides may be made to give up a modicum of nutriment in this way; and doubtless
              barbaric man, before whom starvation always loomed threateningly, found the crude pot
              an almost perennial refuge. And of course its use as a cooking utensil was only one of
              many ways in which the newly discovered mechanism exerted a civilizing influence.</p>

                        <p>The next great progressive movement, which carried man into the Middle Status of
              Barbarism, is associated with the domestication of animals in the Eastern hemisphere,
              and with the use of irrigation in cultivating the soil and of adobe bricks and stone
              in architecture in the Western hemisphere. The dog was probably the first animal to be
              domesticated, but the sheep, the ox, the camel and the horse were doubtless added in
              relatively rapid succession, so soon as the idea that captive animals could be of
              service had been clearly conceived. Man now became a herdsman, no longer dependent for
              food upon the precarious chase of wild animals. Milk, procurable at all seasons, made
              a highly important addition to his dietary. With the aid of camel and horse he could
              traverse wide areas hitherto impassable, and come in contact with distant peoples.
              Thus commerce came to play an extended role in the dissemination of both commodities
              and ideas. In particular the nascent civilization of the Mediterranean region fell
              heir to numerous products of farther Asia,—gums, spices, oils, and most important of
              all, the cereals. The cultivation of the latter gave the finishing touch to a
              comprehensive and varied diet, while emphasizing the value of a fixed abode. For the
              first time it now became possible for large numbers of people to form localized
              communities. A natural consequence was the elaboration of political systems, which,
              however, proceeded along lines already suggested by the experience of earlier epochs.
              All this tended to establish and emphasize the idea of nationality, based primarily on
              blood-relationship ; and at the same time to develop within the community itself the
              idea of property, —that is to say, of valuable or desirable commodities which have
              come into the possession of an individual through his enterprise or labour, and which
              should therefore be subject to his voluntary disposal. At an earlier stage of
              development, all property had been of communal, not of individual, ownership. It
              appears, then, that our mid-period barbarian had attained—if the verbal contradiction
              be permitted—a relatively high stage of civilization.</p>

                        <p>There remained, however, one master craft of which he had no conception. This was the
              art of smelting iron. When, ultimately, his descendants learned the wonderful secrets
              of that art, they rose in consequence to the Upper Status of Barbarism. This
              culminating practical invention, it will be observed, is the first of the great
              discoveries with which we have to do that was not primarily concerned with the
              question of man's food supply. Iron, to be sure, has abundant uses in the same
              connexion, but its most direct and obvious utilities have to do with weapons of war
              and with implements calculated to promote such arts of peace as housebuilding,
              road-making and the construction of vehicles. Wood and stone could now be fashioned as
              never before. Houses could be built and cities walled with unexampled facility; to say
              nothing of the making of a multitude of minor implements and utensils hitherto quite
              unknown, or at best rare and costly. Nor must we overlook the aesthetic influence of
              edged implements, with which wood and stone could readily be sculptured when placed in
              the hands of a race that had long been accustomed to scratch the semblance of living
              forms on bone or ivory and to fashion crude images of clay. In a word, man, the <q>"
                tool-making animal,"</q> was now for the first time provided with tools worthy of
              his wonderful hands and yet more wonderful brain.</p>
                        <p>Thus through the application of one revolutionary invention after another, the most
              advanced races of men had arrived, after long ages of effort, at a relatively high
              stage of development. A very wide range of experiences had enabled man to evolve a
              complex body politic, based on a fairly secure social basis, and his brain had
              correspondingly developed into a relatively efficient and stable organ of thought. But
              as yet he had devised no means of communicating freely with other people at a distance
              except through the medium of verbal messages; nor had he any method by which he could
              transmit his experiences to posterity more securely than by fugitive and fallible oral
              traditions. A vague symbolization of his achievements was preserved from generation to
              generation in myth-tale and epic, but he knew not how to make permanent record of his
              history. Until he could devise a means to make such record, he must remain, in the
              estimate of his descendants, a barbarian, though he might be admitted to have become a
              highly organized and even in a broad sense a cultured being.</p>

                        <p>At length, however, this last barrier was broken. Some race or races devised a method
              of symbolizing events and ultimately of making even abstruse ideas tangible by means
              of graphic signs. In other words, a system of writing was developed. Man thus achieved
              a virtual conquest over time; <pb n="405" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0405.png"/> as he had earlier conquered space. He could now transmit the record of his deeds
              and his thoughts to remote posterity. Thus he stood at the portals of what later
              generations would term secure history. He had graduated out of barbarism, and become
              in the narrower sense of the word a civilized being. Henceforth, his knowledge, his
              poetical dreamings, his moral aspirations might be recorded in such form as to be read
              not merely by his contemporaries but by successive generations of remote posterity.
              The inspiring character of such a message is obvious. The validity of making this
              great culminating intellectual achievement the test of <q>" civilized "</q> existence
              need not be denied. But we should ill comprehend the character of the message which
              the earlier generations of civilized beings transmit to us from the period which we
              term the <q>"dawning of history"</q> did we not bear constantly in mind the long
              series of progressive stages of <q>" savagery "</q> and <q>" barbarism "</q> that of
              necessity preceded the final stage of <q>" civilization"</q> proper. The achievements
              of those earlier stages afforded the secure foundation for the progress of the future.
              A multitude of minor arts, in addition to the important ones just outlined, had been
              developed; and for a long time civilized man was to make no other epochal addition to
              the list of accomplishments that came to him as a heritage from his barbaric
              progenitor. Indeed, even to this day the list of such additions is not a long one,
              nor, judged in the relative scale, so important as might at first thought be supposed.

                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lewis_H._Morgan">Morgan</name>'s suggestion that man's achievements as a barbarian, considered in

                        <p>Without insisting on this comparison, however, let us ask what discoveries and
              inventions man has made within the historical period that may fairly be ranked with
              the half-dozen great epochal achievements that have been put forward as furnishing the
              keys to all the progress of the prehistoric periods. In other words, let us sketch the
              history of progress during the ten thousand years or so that have elapsed since man
              learned the art of writing, adapting our sketch to the same scale which we have
              already applied to the unnumbered millenniums of the prehistoric period. The view of
              world-history thus outlined will be a very different one from what might be expected
              by the student of national history; but it will present the essentials of the progress
              of civilization in a suggestive light.</p>

                        <p>Without pretending to fix an exact date,—which the historical records do not at
              present permit,—we may assume that the most advanced race of men elaborated a system
              of writing not less than six thousand years before the beginning of the Christian era.
              Holding to the terminology already suggested for the earlier periods, we may speak of
              man's position during the ensuing generations as that of the First or Lowest Status of
              civilization. If we review the history of this period we shall find that it extends
              unbroken over a stretch of at least four or five thousand years. During the early part
              of this period such localized civilizations as those of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptians">the Egyptians</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sumer">the Sumerians</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">the Babylonians</name> and
                <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hittites">the Hittites</name>
              rose, grew strong and passed beyond their meridian. This suggests that we must now
              admit the word <q>" civilization "</q> to yet another definition, within its larger
              meaning : we must speak of <q>" a civilization,"</q> as that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</name>, of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name>, of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>, and we must understand
              thereby a localized phase of society bearing the same relation to civilization as a
              whole that a wave bears to the ocean or a tree to the forest. Such other localized
              civilizations as those of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia">Phoenicia</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage">Carthage</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantium">Byzantium</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sassanid_Empire">the
                Sassanids</name>, in due course waxed and waned, leaving a tremendous imprint on
              national history, but creating only minor and transitory ripples in the great ocean of
              civilization. Progress in the elaboration of the details of earlier methods and
              inventions took place as a matter of course. Some nation, probably <name type="people">the Phoenicians</name>, gave a new impetus to the art of writing by developing a
              phonetic alphabet; but this achievement, remarkable as it was in itself, added nothing
              fundamental to human capacity. Literatures had previously flourished through the use
              of hieroglyphic and syllabic symbols; and the Babylonian syllables continued in vogue
              throughout western Asia for a long time after the Phoenician alphabet had demonstrated
              its intrinsic superiority.</p>
                        <p>Similarly the art of Egyptian and Assyrian and Greek was but the elaboration and
              perfection of methods that barbaric man had practised away back in the days when he
              was a cave-dweller. The weapons of warfare of Greek and Roman were the spear and the
              bow and arrow that their ancestors had used in the period of savagery, aided by sword
              and helmet dating from the upper period of barbarism. Greek and Roman government at
              their best were founded upon the system of <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi>
                            </foreign> that barbaric man had profoundly studied,—as witness, for example, the
              federal system of the barbaric <name type="people">Iroquois Indians</name> existing in
              America before the coming of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christopher_Columbus">Columbus</name>. And if the
              Greeks had better literature, the Romans better roads and larger cities, than their
              predecessors, these are but matters of detailed development, the like of which had
              marked the progress of the more important arts and the introduction of less important
              ancillary ones in each antecedent period. The axe of steel is no new implement, but a
              mere perfecting of the axe of chipped flint. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ILiad">The Iliad</title> represents the perfecting
              of an art that unnumbered generations of barbarians practised before their
              camp-fires.</p>

                        <p>Thus for six or seven thousand years after man achieved civilization there was
              rhythmic progress in many lines, but there came no great epochal invention to usher in
              a new ethnic period. Then, towards the close of what historians of to-day are
              accustomed to call <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>, there appeared in rapid sequence three or four inventions
              and a great scientific discovery that, taken together, were destined to change the
              entire aspect of European civilization. The inventions were gunpowder, the mariner's
              compass, paper and the printing-press, three of which appear to have been brought into
              Europe by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moors">the
              Moors</name>, whether or not they originated in the remote East. The scientific
              discovery which must be coupled with these inventions was the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Copernican</name>
              demonstration that the sun and not the earth is the centre of our planetary system.
              The generations of men that found themselves <list>

                  through the aid of paper and printing-press</item>
                            </list>—such generations of men might well be said to have entered upon a new ethnic
              period. The transition in their mode of thought and in their methods of practical life
              was as great as can be supposed to have resulted, in an early generation, from the
              introduction of iron, or in a yet earlier from the invention of the bow and arrow. So
              the Europeans of about the 15th century of the Christian era may be said to have
              entered upon the Second or Middle Status of civilization.</p>

              turned men's ideas topsy-turvy by demonstrating that the world as the abiding-place of
              animals and man is enormously old, and that man himself instead of deteriorating from
              a single perfect pair six thousand years removed, has ascended from bestiality through
              a slow process of evolution extending over hundreds of centuries. The revolution in
              practical life and in the mental life of our race that followed these inventions and
              this new presentation of truth probably exceeded in suddenness and in its far-reaching
              effects the metamorphosis effected at any previous transition from one ethnic period
              to another. The men of the 19th century, living now in the period that may be termed
              the Upper Status <pb n="406" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0406.png"/> of
              civilization, saw such changes effected in the practical affairs of their everyday
              lives as had not been wrought before during the entire historical period. Their
              fathers had travelled in vehicles drawn by horses, quite as their remoter ancestors
              had done since the time of higher barbarism. It may be doubted whether there existed
              in the world in the year 1800 a postal service that could compare in speed and
              efficiency with the express service of the Romans of the time of Caesar; far less was
              there a telegraph service that could compare with that of the ancient Persians. Nor
              was there a ship sailing the seas that a Phoenician trireme might not have overhauled.
              But now within the lifetime of a single man the world was covered with a network of
              steel rails on which locomotives drew gigantic vehicles, laden with passengers at an
              hourly speed almost equalling Caesar's best journey of a day; over the land and under
              the seas were stretched wires along which messages coursed from continent to continent
              literally with the speed of lightning ; and the waters of the earth were made to teem
              with gigantic craft propelled without sail or oar at a speed which the Phoenician
              captain of three thousand years ago and the English captain of the 18th century would
              alike have held incredible.</p>

                        <p>There is no need to give further details here of the industrial revolutions that have
              been achieved in this newest period of civilization, since in their broader outlines
              at least they are familiar to every one. Nor need we dwell upon the revolution in
              thought whereby man has for the first time been given a clear inkling as to his origin
              and destiny. It suffices to point out that such periods of fermentation of ideas as
              this suggests have probably always been concomitant with those outbursts of creative
              genius that gave the world the practical inventions upon which human progress has been
              conditioned. The same attitude of receptivity to new ideas is pre-requisite to one
              form of discovery as to the other. Nor, it may be added, can either form of idea
              become effective for the progress of civilization except in proportion as a large body
              of any given generation are prepared to receive it. Doubtless here and there a dreamer
              played with fire, in a literal sense, for generations before the utility of fire as a
              practical aid to human progress came to be recognized in practice. And— to seek an
              illustration at the other end of the scale—we know that the advanced thinkers of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> and
                <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>
              believed in the antiquity of the earth and in the evolution of man two thousand years
              before the coming of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</name>. We have but partly
              solved the mysteries of the progress of civilization, then, when we have pointed out
              that each tangible stage of progress owed its initiative to a new invention or
              discovery of science. To go to the root of the matter we must needs explain how it
              came about that a given generation of men was in mental mood to receive the new
              invention or discovery.</p>
                        <p>The pursuit of this question would carry us farther into the realm of communal and
              racial psychology—to say nothing of the realm of conjecture—than comports with the
              purpose of this article. It must suffice to point out that alertness of mind— that all
              mentality—is, in the last analysis, a reaction to the influences of the environment.
              It follows that man may subject himself to new influences and thus give his mind a new
              stimulus by changing his habitat. A fundamental secret of progress is revealed in this
              fact. Man probably never would have evolved from savagery had he remained in the
              Tropics where he doubtless originated. But successive scientific inventions enabled
              him, as has been suggested, to migrate to distant latitudes, and thus more or less
              involuntarily to become the recipient of new creative and progressive impulses. After
              migrations in many directions had resulted in the development of divers races, each
              with certain capacities and acquirements due to its unique environment, there was
              opportunity for the application of the principle of environmental stimulus in an
              indirect way, through the mingling and physical intermixture of one race with another.
              Each of the great localized civilizations of antiquity appears to have owed its
              prominence in part at least—perhaps very largely—to such intermingling of two or more
              races. Each of these civilizations began to decay so soon as the nation had remained
              for a considerable number of generations in its localized environment, and had
              practically ceased to receive accretions from distant races at approximately the same
              stage of development. There is a suggestive lesson for present-day civilization in
              that thought-compelling fact. Further evidence of the application of the principle of
              environmental stimulus, operating through changed habitat and racial intermixture, is
              furnished by the virility of the colonial peoples of our own day. The receptiveness to
              new ideas and the rapidity of material progress of Americans, South Africans and
              Australians are proverbial. No one doubts, probably, that one or another of these
              countries will give a new stimulus to the progress of civilization, through the
              promulgation of some great epochal discovery, in the not distant future. Again, the
              value of racial intermingling is shown yet nearer home in the long-continued vitality
              of the British nation, which is explicable, in some measure at least, by the fact that
              the Celtic element held aloof from the Anglo-Saxon element century after century
              sufficiently to maintain racial integrity, yet mingled sufficiently to give and
              receive the fresh stimulus of <q>" new blood."</q> It is interesting in this connexion
              to examine the map of Great Britain with reference to the birthplaces of the men named
              above as being the originators of the inventions and discoveries that made the close
              of the 18th century memorable as ushering in a new ethnic era. It may be added that
              these names suggest yet another element in the causation of progress : the fact,
              namely, that, however necessary racial receptivity may be to the dynamitic upheaval of
              a new ethnic era, it is after all <hi rend="italic">individual</hi> genius that
              applies its detonating spark.</p>

              recapitulate the analysis of the evolution of civilization above given, prior to
              characterizing it from another standpoint. It appears that the entire period of human
              progress up to the present may be divided into nine periods which, if of necessity
              more or less arbitrary, yet are not without certain warrant of logic. They may be

                                <item>(9) The Upper Period of Civilization, which is still in progress, but which,
                  as will be suggested in a moment, is probably nearing its termination.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>It requires but a glance at the characteristics of these successive epochs to show
              the ever-increasing complexity of the inventions that delimit them and of the
              conditions of life that they connote. Were we to attempt to characterize in a few
              phrases the entire story of achievement thus outlined, we might say that during the
              three stages of Savagery man was attempting to make himself master of the geographical
              climates. His unconscious ideal was, to gain a foothold and the means of subsistence
              in every zone. During the three periods of Barbarism the ideal of conquest was
              extended to the beasts of the field, the vegetable world, and the mineral contents of
              the earth's crust. During the three periods of Civilization proper the ideal of
              conquest has become still more intellectual and subtle, being now extended to such
              abstractions as an analysis of speech-sounds, and to such intangibles as expanding
              gases and still more elusive electric currents : in other words, to the forces of
              nature, no less than to tangible substances. Hand in hand with this growing complexity
              of man's relations with the external world has gone a like increase of complexity in
              the social and political organizations that characterize man's relations with his
              fellow- <pb n="407" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0407.png"/> men. In savagery
              the family expanded into the tribe; in barbarism the tribe developed into the nation.
              The epoch of civilization proper is aptly named, because it has been a time in which
              citizenship, in the narrower national significance, has probably been developed to its
              apogee. Throughout this period, in every land, the highest virtue has been considered
              to be patriotism,—by which must be understood an instinctive willingness on the part
              of every individual to defend even with his life the interests of the nation into
              which he chances to be born, regardless of whether the national cause in which he
              struggles be in any given case good or bad, right or wrong. The communal judgment of
              this epoch pronounces any man a traitor who will not uphold his own nation even in a
              wrong cause—and the word <q>" traitor "</q> marks the utmost brand of ignominy.</p>

                        <p>But while the idea of nationality has thus been accentuated, there has been a
              never-ending struggle within the bounds of the nation itself to adjust the relations
              of one citizen to another. The ideas that might makes right, that the strong man must
              dominate the weak, that leadership in the community properly belongs to the man who is
              physically most competent to lead—these ideas were a perfectly natural, and indeed an
              inevitable, outgrowth of the conditions under which man fought his way up through
              savagery and barbarism. Man in the first period of civilization inherited these ideas,
              along with the conditions of society that were their concomitants. So throughout the
              periods when the oriental civilizations of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name> and Persia were dominant, a
              despotic form of government was accepted as the natural order of things. It does not
              appear that any other form was even considered as a practicality. A despot might
              indeed be overthrown, but only to make way for the coronation of another despot. A
              little later the Greeks and Romans modified the conception of a heaven-sent individual
              monarch; but they went no further than to substitute a heaven-favoured community, with
              specially favoured groups <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">(Patricii)</hi>
                            </foreign> within the community. With this, national egoism reached its climax ; for
              each people regarded its own citizens as the only exemplars of civilization, openly
              branding all the rest of the world as <q>" barbarians,"</q> fit subjects for the
              exaction of tribute or for the imposition of the bonds of actual slavery. During <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>
              there was a reaction towards individualism as opposed to nationalism: but the entire
              system of feudalism, with its clearly recognized conditions of over-lordship and of
              vassaldom, gave expression, no less clearly than oriental despotism and classical <q>"
                democracy "</q> had done, to the idea of individual inequality ; of divergence of
              moral and legal status based on natural inheritance. Thus this idea, a reminiscence of
              barbarism, maintained its dominance throughout the first period of civilization.</p>
                        <p>But gunpowder, marking the transition to the second period of civilization, came as a
              great levelling influence. With its aid the weakest peasant might prove more than a
              match for the most powerful knight. Before its assaults the castle of the lord ceased
              to be an impregnable fortress. And while gunpowder thus levelled down the power of the
              mighty, the printing-press levelled up the intelligence, and hence the power and
              influence of the lowly. Meantime the mariner's compass opened up new territories
              beyond the seas, and in due course men of lowly origin were seen to attain to wealth
              and power through commercial pursuits, thus tending to break in upon the established
              social order. In the colonial territories themselves all men were subjected more or
              less to the same perils and dependent upon their own efforts. Success and prominence
              in the community came not as a birthright, but as the result of demonstrated fitness.
              The great lesson that the interests of all members of a community are, in the last
              analysis, mutual could be more clearly distinguished in these small colonies than in
              larger and older bodies politic. Through various channels, therefore, in the
              successive generations of this middle period of civilization, the idea gained ground
              that intelligence and moral worth, rather than physical prowess, should be the test of
              greatness; that it is incumbent on the strong in the interests of the body politic to
              protect the weak; and that, in the long run, the best interests of the community are
              conserved if all its members, without exception, are given moral equality before the
              law. This idea of equal rights and privileges for all members of the community—for
              each individual <q>" the greatest amount of liberty consistent with a like liberty of
                every other individual "</q>—first found expression as a philosophical doctrine
              towards the close of the 18th century ; at which time also tentative efforts were made
              to put it into practice. It may be said therefore to represent the culminating
              sociological doctrine of the middle period of civilization,—the ideal towards which
              all the influences of the period had tended to impel the race.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed, however, that this ideal of individual equality within the body
              politic in no direct wise influences the status of the body politic itself as the
              centre of a localized civilization that, may be regarded as in a sense antagonistic to
              all other similarly localized civilizations. If there were any such influence, it
              would rather operate in the direction of accentuating the patriotism of the member of
              a democratical community, as against that of the subject of a despot, through the
              sense of personal responsibility developed in the former. The developments of the
              middle period of civilization cannot be considered, therefore, to have tended to
              decrease the spirit of nationality, with its concomitant penalty of what is sometimes
              called provincialism. The history of this entire period, as commonly presented, is
              largely made up of the records of international rivalries and jealousies, perennially
              culminating in bitterly contested wars. It was only towards the close of the epoch
              that the desirability of free commercial intercourse among nations began to find
              expression as a philosophical creed through the efforts of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Quesnay">Quesnay</name> and his followers
              ; and the doctrine that both parties to an international commercial transaction are
              gainers thereby found its first clear expression in the year 1776 in the pages of
                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Étienne_Bonnot_de_Condillac">Condillac</name> and of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adam_Smith">Adam Smith</name>.</p>
                        <p>But the discoveries that ushered in the third period of civilization were destined to
              work powerfully from the outset for the breaking down of international barriers,
              though, of course, their effects would not be at once manifest. Thus the substitution
              of steam power for water power, besides giving a tremendous impetus to manufacturing
              in general, mapped out new industrial centres in regions that nature had supplied with
              coal but not always with other raw materials. To note a single result, England became
              the manufacturing centre of the world, drawing its raw materials from every corner of
              the globe; but in so doing it ceased to be self-supporting as regards the production
              of food-supplies. While growing in national wealth, as a result of the new inventions,
              England has therefore lost immeasurably in national self-sufficiency and independence;
              having become in large measure dependent upon other countries both for the raw
              materials without which her industries must perish and for the foods to maintain the
              very life of her people.</p>
                        <p>What is true of England in this regard is of course true in greater or less measure
              of all other countries. Everywhere, thanks to the new mechanisms that increase
              industrial efficiency, there has been an increasing tendency to specialization; and
              since the manufacturer must often find his raw materials in one part of the world and
              his markets in another, this implies an ever-increasing intercommunication and
              interdependence between the nations. This spirit is obviously fostered by the new
              means of transportation by locomotive and steamship, and by the electric communication
              that enables the Londoner, for example, to transact business in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name> or in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo">Tokio</name> with scarcely an
              hour's delay ; and that puts every one in touch at to-day's breakfast table with the
              happenings of the entire world. Thanks to the new mechanisms, national isolation is no
              longer possible ; globe-trotting has become a habit with thousands of individuals of
              many nations; and Orient and Occident, representing civilizations that for thousands
              of years were almost absolutely severed and mutually oblivious of each other, have
              been brought again into close touch for mutual education and betterment. The Western
              mind has learned with amazement that the aforetime <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">Terra Incognita</hi>
                            </foreign> of the far East has nurtured a gigantic civilization having ideals in many
              ways far different from our own. The Eastern mind has proved itself capable, in <pb n="408" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0408.png"/> self-defence, of absorbing
              the essential practicalities of Western civilization within a single generation. Some
              of the most important problems of world-civilization of the immediate future hinge
              upon the mutual relations of these two long-severed communities, branched at some
              early stage of progress to opposite hemispheres of the globe, but now brought by the
              new mechanisms into daily and even hourly communication.</p>

                        <p>While the new conditions of the industrial world have thus tended to develop a new
              national outlook, there has come about, as a result of the scientific discoveries
              already referred to, a no less significant broadening of the mental and spiritual
              horizons. Here also the trend is away from the narrowly egoistic and towards the
              cosmopolitan view. About the middle of the 19th century <name type="person">Dr
                Pritchard</name>
                            <note type="uncertainty" resp="#gorobiy">There were many people called Pritchard (see
                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritchard), but the exact identification is uncertain.
                – Alexey Gorobiy</note> declared that many people debated whether it might not be
              permissible for the Australian settlers to shoot the natives as food for their dogs ;
              some of the disputants arguing that savages were without the pale of human
              brotherhood. To-day the thesis that all mankind are one brotherhood needs no defence.
              The most primitive of existing aborigines are regarded merely as brethren who, through
              some defect or neglect of opportunity, have lagged behind in the race. Similarly the
              defective and criminal classes that make up so significant a part of the population of
              even our highest present-day civilizations, are no longer regarded with anger or
              contempt, as beings who are suffering just punishment for wilful transgressions, but
              are considered as pitiful victims of hereditary and environmental influences that they
              could neither choose nor control. Insanity is no longer thought of as demoniac
              possession, but as the most lamentable of diseases.</p>
                        <p>The changed attitude towards savage races and defective classes affords tangible
              illustrations of a fundamental transformation of point of view which doubtless
              represents the most important result of the operation of new scientific knowledge in
              the course of the 19th century. It is a transformation that is only partially effected
              as yet, to be sure ; but it is rapidly making headway, and when fully achieved it will
              represent, probably, the most radical metamorphosis of mental view that has taken
              place in the entire course of the historical period. The essence of the new view is
              this: to recognize the universality and the invariability of natural law; stated
              otherwise, to understand that the word <q>" supernatural"</q> involves a contradiction
              of terms and has in fact no meaning. Whoever has grasped the full import of this truth
              is privileged to sweep mental horizons wider by far than ever opened to the view of
              any thinker of an earlier epoch. He is privileged to forecast, as the sure heritage of
              the future, a civilization freed from the last ghost of superstition— an Age of Reason
              in which mankind shall at last find refuge from the hosts of occult and invisible
              powers, the fearsome galaxies of deities and demons, which have haunted him thus far
              at every stage of his long journey through savagery, barbarism and civilization.
              Doubtless here and there a thinker, even in the barbaric eras, may have realized that
              these ghosts that so influenced the everyday lives of his fellows were but children of
              the imagination. But the certainty that such is the case could not have come with the
              force of demonstration even to the most clear-sighted thinker until 19th-century
              science had investigated with penetrating vision the realm of molecule and atom; had
              revealed the awe-inspiring principle of the conservation of energy; and had offered a
              comprehensible explanation of the evolution of one form of life from another, from
              monad to man, that did not presuppose the intervention of powers more <q>"
                supernatural"</q> than those that operate about us everywhere to-day.</p>
                        <p>The stupendous import of these new truths could not, of course, make itself evident
              to the generality of mankind in a single generation, when opposed to superstitions of
              a thousand generations' standing. But the new knowledge has made its way more
              expeditiously than could have been anticipated; and its effects are seen on every
              side, even where its agency is scarcely recognized. As a single illustration, we may
              note the familiar observation that the entire complexion of orthodox teaching of
              religion has been more altered in the past fifty years than in two thousand years
              before. This of course is not entirely due to the influence of physical and biological
              science; no effect has a unique cause, in the complex sociological scheme.
              Archaeology, comparative philology and textual criticism have also contributed their
              share; and the comparative study of religions has further tended to broaden the
              outlook and to make for universality, as opposed to insularity, of view. It is coming
              to be more and more widely recognized that all theologies are but the reflex of the
              more or less faulty knowledge of the times in which they originate; that the true and
              abiding purpose of religion should be the practical betterment of humanity—the
              advancement of civilization in the best sense of the word ; and that this end may
              perhaps be best subserved by different systems of theology, adapted to the varied
              genius of different times and divers races. Wherefore there is not the same
              enthusiastic desire to-day that found expression a generation ago, to impose upon the
              cultured millions of the East a religion that seems to them alien to their manner of
              thought, unsuited to their needs and less distinctly ethical in teaching than their
              own religions.</p>
                        <p>Such are but a few of the illustrations that might be cited from many fields to
              suggest that the mind of our generation is becoming receptive to a changed point of
              view that augurs the coming of a new ethnic era. If one may be permitted to enter very
              tentatively the field of prophecy, it seems not unlikely that the great revolutionary
              invention which will close the third period of civilization and usher in a new era is
              already being evolved. It seems not over-hazardous to predict that the air-ship, in
              one form or another, is destined to be the mechanism that will give the new impetus to
              human civilization; that the next era will have as one of its practical ideals the
              conquest of the air; and that this conquest will become a factor in the final
              emergence of humanity from the insularity of nationalism to the broad view of
              cosmopolitanism, towards which, as we have seen, the tendencies of the present era are
              verging. That the gap to be covered is a vastly wide one no one need be reminded who
              recalls that the civilized nations of Europe, together with America and Japan, are at
              present accustomed to spend more than three hundred million pounds each year merely
              that they may keep armaments in readiness to fly at one another's throats should
              occasion arise. Formidable as these armaments now seem, however, the developments of
              the not very distant future will probably make them quite obsolete; and sooner or
              later, as science develops yet more deadly implements of destruction, the time must
              come when communal intelligence will rebel at the suicidal folly of the international
              attitude that characterized, for example, the opening decade of the 20th century. At
              some time, after the first period of cosmopolitanism shall be ushered in as a tenth
              ethnic period, it will come to be recognized that there is a word fraught with fuller
              meanings even than the word patriotism. That word is humanitarianism. The enlightened
              generation that realizes the full implications of that word will doubtless marvel that
              their ancestors of the third period of civilization should have risen up as nations
              and slaughtered one another by thousands to settle a dispute about a geographical
              boundary. Such a procedure will appear to have been quite as barbarous as the
              cannibalistic practices of their yet more remote ancestors, and distinctly less
              rational, since cannibalism might sometimes save its practiser from starvation,
              whereas warfare of the civilized type was a purely destructive agency.</p>
                        <p>Equally obvious must it appear to the cosmopolite of some generation of the future
              that quality rather than mere numbers must determine the efficiency of any given
              community. Race suicide will then cease to be a bugbear; and it will no longer be
              considered rational to keep up the census at the cost of propagating low orders of
              intelligence, to feed the ranks of paupers, defectives and criminals. On the contrary
              it will be thought fitting that man should become the conscious arbiter of his own
              racial destiny to the extent of applying whatever laws of heredity he knows or may
              acquire in the interests of his own species, as he has long applied them in the case
              of domesticated animals. The survival and procreation of the unfit will then cease to
              be a menace to the progress of civilization. It does not follow that <pb n="409" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0409.png"/> all men will be brought to a dead
              level of equality of body and mind, nor that individual competition will cease ; but
              the average physical mental status of the race will be raised immeasurably through the
              virtual elimination of that vast company of defectives which to-day constitutes so
              threatening an obstacle to racial progress. There are millions of men in Europe and
              America to-day whose whole mental equipment—despite the fact that they have been
              taught to read and write—is far more closely akin to the average of the Upper Period
              of Barbarism than to the highest standards of their own time ; and these undeveloped
              or atavistic persons have on the average more offspring than are produced by the more
              highly cultured and intelligent among their contemporaries. <q>" Race suicide "</q> is
              thereby prevented, but the progress of civilization is no less surely handicapped. We
              may well believe that the cosmopolite of the future, aided by science, will find
              rational means to remedy this strange illogicality. In so doing he will exercise a
              more consciously purposeful function, and perhaps a more directly potent influence, in
              determining the line of human progress than he has hitherto attempted to assume,
              notwithstanding the almost infinitely varied character of the experiments through
              which he has worked his way from savagery to civilization.</p>

                        <p>All these considerations tend to define yet more clearly the ultimate goal towards
              which the progressive civilization of past and present appears to be trending. The
              contemplation of this goal brings into view the outlines of a vastly suggestive
              evolutionary cycle. For it appears that the social condition of cosmopolite man, so
              far as the present-day view can predict it, will represent a state of things,
              magnified to world-dimensions, that was curiously adumbrated by the social system of
              the earliest savage. At the very beginning of the journey through savagery, mankind,
              we may well believe, consisted of a limited tribe, representing no great range or
              variety of capacity, and an almost absolute identity of interests. Thanks to this
              community of interests,—which was fortified by the recognition of blood-relationship
              among all members of the tribe, principle which we now define as <q>" the greatest
                ultimate good to the greatest number "</q> found practical, even if unwitting,
              recognition ; and therein lay the germs of all the moral development of the future.
              But obvious identity of interests could be recognized only so long as the tribe
              remained very small. So soon as its numbers became large, patent diversities of
              interest, based on individual selfishness, must appear, to obscure the larger harmony.
              And as savage man migrated hither and thither, occupying new regions and thus
              developing new tribes and ultimately a diversity of <q>"races,"</q> all idea of
              community of interests, as between race and race, must have been absolutely banished.
              It was the obvious and patent fact that each race was more or less at rivalry, in
              disharmony, with all the others. In the hard struggle for subsistence, the expansion
              of one race meant the downfall of another. So far as any principle of <q>" greatest
                good "</q> remained in evidence, it applied solely to the members of one's own
              community, or even to one's particular phratry or gens.</p>
                        <p>Barbaric man, thanks to his conquest of animal and vegetable nature was able to
              extend the size of the unified community, and hence to develop through diverse and
              intricate channels the application of the principle of <q>" greatest good "</q> out of
              which the idea of right and wrong was elaborated. But quite as little as the savage
              did he think of extending the application of the principle beyond the bounds of his
              own race. The laws with which he gave expression to his ethical conceptions applied,
              of necessity, to his own people alone. The gods with which his imagination peopled the
              world were local in habitat, devoted to the interests of his race only, and at enmity
              with the gods of rival peoples. As between nation and nation, the only principle of
              ethics that ever occurred to him was that might makes right. Civilized man for a long
              time advanced but slowly upon this view of international morality. No Egyptian or
              Babylonian or Hebrew or Greek or Roman ever hesitated to attack a weaker nation on the
              ground that it would be wrong to do so. And few indeed are the instances in which even
              a modern nation has judged an international question on any other basis than that of
              self-interest. It was not till towards the close of the 19th century that an
              International Peace Conference gave tangible witness that the idea of fellowship of
              nations was finding recognition; and in the same recent period history has recorded
              the first instance of a powerful nation vanquishing a weaker one without attempting to
              exact at least an <q>" indemnifying "</q> tribute.</p>
                        <p>But the citizen of the future, if the auguries of the present prove true, will be
              able to apply principles of right and wrong without reference to national boundaries.
              He will understand that the interests of the entire human family are, in the last
              analysis, common interests. The census through which he attempts to estimate <q>" the
                greatest good of the greatest number "</q> must include, not his own nation merely,
              but the remotest member of the human race. On this universal basis must be founded
              that absolute standard of ethics which will determine the relations of cosmopolite man
              with his fellows. When this ideal is attained, mankind will again represent a single
              family, as it did in the day when our primeval ancestors first entered on the pathway
              of progress ; but it will be a family whose habitat has been extended from the narrow
              glade of some tropical forest to the utmost habitable confines of the globe. Each
              member of this family will be permitted to enjoy the greatest amount of liberty
              consistent with the like liberty of every other member ; but the interests of the few
              will everywhere be recognized as subservient to the interests of the many, and such
              recognition of mutual interests will establish the practical criterion for the
              interpretation of international affairs.</p>

                        <p>But such an extension of the altruistic principle by no means presupposes the
              elimination of egoistic impulses—of individualism. On the contrary, we must suppose
              that man at the highest stages of culture will be, even as was the savage, a seeker
              after the greatest attainable degree of comfort for the least necessary expenditure of
              energy. The pursuit of this ideal has been from first to last the ultimate impelling
              force in nature urging man forward. The only change has been a change in the
              interpretation of the ideal, an altered estimate as to what manner of things are
              mostworth the purchaseprice of toil and self-denial. That the things most worth the
              having cannot, generally speaking, be secured without such toil and self-denial, is a
              lesson that began to be inculcated while man was a savage, and that has never ceased
              to be reiterated generation after generation. It is the final test of progressive
              civilization that a given effort shall produce a larger and larger modicum of average
              individual comfort. That is why the great inventions that have increased man's
              efficiency as a worker have been the necessarv prerequisites to racial progress.
              Stated otherwise, that is why the industrial factor is everywhere the most powerful
              factor in civilization ; and why the economic interpretation is the most searching
              interpretation of history at its every stage. It is the basal fact that progress
              implies increased average working efficiency—a growing ratio between average effort
              and average achievement—that gives sure warrant for such a prognostication as has just
              been attempted concerning the future industrial unification of our race. The efforts
              of civilized man provide him, on the average, with a marvellous range of comforts, as
              contrasted with those that rewarded the most strenuous efforts of savage or barbarian,
              to whom present-day necessaries would have been undreamed-of luxuries. But the ideal
              ratio between effort and result has by no means been achieved; nor will it have been
              until the inventive brain of man has provided a civilization in which a far higher
              percentage of citizens will find the life-vocations to which they are best adapted by
              nature, and in which, therefore, the efforts of the average worker may be directed
              with such vigour, enthusiasm and interest as can alone make for true efficiency ; a
              civilization adjusted to such an economic balance that the average man may live in
              reasonable comfort without heart-breaking strain, and yet accumulate a sufficient
              surplus to ensure ease and serenity for his declining days. Such, seemingly, should be
              the normal goal of progressive civilization. Doubtless mankind in advancing towards
              that goal will institute many changes that could by no possibility be <pb n="410" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0410.png"/> foretold; but (to summarize the views

                        <p>In the following treatment of this subject, the theory and early history of education
              is first dealt with, and secondly the modern organization of education as a national
              concern. Many definitions have been given of the word <q>"education,"</q> but
              underlying them all is the conception that it denotes an attempt on the part of the
              adult members of a human society to shape the development of the coming generation in
              accordance with its own ideals of life. It is true that the word has not infrequently
              been used in wider senses than this. For example, <ref>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">J.S.
                  Mill</name> included under it everything which <quote>"helps to shape the human
                  being"</quote>
                            </ref>; and, with some poetic licence, we speak of the education of a people or even
              of the whole human race. But all such usages are rhetorical extensions of the commonly
              accepted sense of the term, which includes, as an essential element, the idea of
              deliberate direction and training (Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">educare</hi>
                            </foreign>, to bring up; <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">educere</hi>
                            </foreign>, to draw out, lead forth). No doubt, all education is effected through the
              experiences of the educated, and much of it is indirect, consisting mainly in the
              determination of the form of experiences other than those of direct precept,
              compulsion and instruction. But it does not follow that all experiences are educative.
              Whether an experience is part of an individual's education or not is determined by its
              origin. Whatever be its effect, it is educative in so far as its form has been
              arranged with greater or less deliberation by those who are concerned with the
              training of him whose experience it is. It follows that an education may be good or
              bad, and that its goodness or badness will be relative to the virtue, wisdom and
              intelligence of the educator. It is good only when it aims at the right kind of
              product, and when the means it adopts are well adapted to secure the intended result
              and are applied intelligently, consistently and persistently.</p>
                        <p>Education is, thus, a definitely personal work, and will vary between wide extremes
              of effectiveness and worth in any given society. For in all times and places there are
              wide differences in virtue, wisdom and capacity among those who have in their hands
              the care and nurture of the young. But the inference that, therefore, no comparative
              estimate of the education of different times and places can be made would be
              fallacious. For, despite all differences in conception and efficiency among individual
              educators, each expresses, more or less perfectly and clearly, the common conception
              and energy of his age and country. As these rise or fall the general level of the
              actual educative practice rises or sinks with them. The first essential for successful
              educative effort is, then, that the community as a whole should have a true estimate
              of the nature and value of education.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>In any comparative estimate of different places and times, as tested by the
                standard just given, it must be borne in mind that, except in the most general and
                abstract form, we cannot speak of an ideally best education. Looking at the
                individual to be educated, we may say with <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> that the
                  aim of education is <quote>"to develop in the body and in the soul all the beauty
                    and all the perfection of which they are capable,"</quote>
                                </ref> but this leaves quite undecided the nature and form of that beauty and
                perfection, and on such points there has never been universal agreement at any one
                time, while successive ages have shown marked differences of estimate. We get nearer
                to the point when we reflect that individual beauty and perfection are shown, and
                only shown, in actual life, and that such life has to be lived under definite
                conditions of time, place, culture, religion, national aspirations and mastery over
                material conditions. Perfection of life, then, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">the Athens</name> of the age of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> would show a
                very different form from that which it would take in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> or <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> of to-day. So an
                individualistic statement of the purpose of education leads on analysis to
                considerations that are not, in themselves, individualistic. The personal life is
                throughout a relation between individual promptings to activity and the environment
                in which alone such promptings can, by being actualized, become part of life. And
                the perfection of the life is to be sought in the perfection of the relations thus
                established. So far, then, as any conception of education can give guidance to the
                actual process it must be relative in every way to the state of development of the
                society in which it is given. Indeed, looked at in the mass, education may be said
                to be the efforts made by the community to impose its culture upon the growing
                generation. Here again is room for difference. The culture in question may be
                accepted as absolute at least in its essentials, and then the ideal of education
                will be to secure its stability and perpetuation, or it may be regarded as a stage
                in a process of development, and then the ideal will be to facilitate the advance of
                the next generation beyond the point reached by the present. So some ages will show
                a relatively fixed conception of the educative process, others will be times of
                unrest and change in this as in other modes of social and intellectual life.</p>
                            <p>It is in these latter times that the actual work of education is apt to lose touch
                with the culture of the community. For schools (q.v.) and universities (q.v.), which
                are the ordinary channels through which adult culture reaches the young, are
                naturally conservative and bound by tradition. They are slow to leave the old paths
                which have hitherto led to the desired goal, and to enter on new and untried ways.
                If the opposition to change is absolute, there must come a time when the instruments
                of education are out of true relation to the desired end. For change in culture
                ideals means change in the specific form of the goal of education, and consequently
                the paths of educative effort need readjustment. When the goal of the past is no
                longer the goal of the present, to follow the ways which led to <pb n="952" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0952.png"/> the former is to fail to reach the
                latter. Continuous readjustment, by small and almost imperceptible degrees, is the
                ideal at which the educator should aim. When this is not secured, the educational
                domain is liable to sudden and violent revolutions which are destructive of
                successful educative effort at the time they occur, however beneficial their results
                may be in the future.</p>
                            <p>But the relation of adjustment is not entirely one-sided. The tone of thought and
                feeling and the direction of will induced by education necessarily affect, the
                common ideals of the next generation, and may make them better or worse than those
                of the present. Hence, the educator must not blindly accept all current views of
                life, but rather select the highest. For the average thought of every community is
                obviously below its best thought; and may, in some points at any rate, be lower than
                the best thought of a past age. While, then, all true education must be in direct
                relation with the culture of its age and country, yet, especially on the ethical
                side, it should aim at transcending the average thought and tone.</p>
                            <p>Still more does this imply that education strives to transcend the present
                condition of the educated by making their life more rational, more volitional, and
                more attracted by goodness and beauty than it would otherwise be. It can never be a
                passive watching of the child's development. No more fundamental error can be made
                than the assumption that education can be determined wholly, or even mainly, by the
                tendencies and impulses with which a child is endowed. Its real guiding principle
                must be a conception of the nature to which the child may attain, not a knowledge of
                that with which it starts. The educator studies the original endowment of the child
                and the early stages in the development of that innate nature in order that he may,
                wisely and successfully, employ appropriate means to direct further development and
                to accelerate its progress towards a more rational, complete and worthy life; not
                that he may the more skilfully give facilities to the child to drift about on the
                unregulated currents of caprice.</p>
                            <p>Such considerations show the importance of an insight into the theory of education
                on the part of all who are practically concerned with its direction. But the theory
                required is no system of abstract ideas ignoring the real concrete conditions of the
                life for which the actual education it is to guide is a preparation. To approach the
                subject only from the standpoint of the mental sciences which underlie it is to run
                the risk of setting up such a body of abstractions, whose relation to real life is
                neither very close nor very direct. The most profitable way of developing an
                educational theory for the present is to trace how in the past education has
                consciously adapted itself, more or less truly and fully, to the conditions of
                culture and social life; and by analysis to discover the reasons for comparative
                success or failure in the degree of clearness with which the end to be sought was
                apprehended and the nature of the children to be trained was understood.</p>
                            <p>In all ages the claims of the individual and those of the community have struggled
                for the mastery as the ultimate principles of life. As one or the other has
                prevailed the conception of education has emphasized social service or individual
                success as the primary end. The true harmony of human life will only be attained
                when these two impulses, contradictory on their own level, are united in a higher
                synthesis which sees each as the complement of the other in a life whose purpose is
                neither simple egoism nor pure altruism. Until that conception of life is attained
                and held generally there can be no sure and universally accepted conception of the
                aim and function of education. Much of the interest of the history of education
                  <note>For the evolution of the school as such from early times see SCHOOLS.</note>
                turns on the relation of these two principles as determinants of its aim.</p>

                  Greece</name> the supremacy of the state was generally unquestioned, and,
                especially in the earlier times, the good man was identified with the good citizen.
                No doubt, in later days phflosophers, such as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, saw clearly that the
                round of the duties of citizenship did not exhaust the life of the individual. With
                them the highest life was one of cultured leisure in which the energies were mainly
                concentrated on the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. But this
                  <q>"diagogic"</q> life was only for the select few; for the undistinguished many
                the fulfilment by each of the duties of his station remained the measure of worthy
                life, though such duties were regarded as affecting the individual and private
                relations of the citizens in a much more intimate way than in former and ruder ages.
                And for those who devoted their lives to the highest culture, the essential
                preliminary condition was the existence of such a state as would form the most
                favourable environment for their pursuits and the most stable foundation for their
                leisured life. Thus Greek thought was saturated with the conception of life as
                essentially a set of relations between the individual and the city-state of which he
                formed an integral part. The first aim of education was therefore to train the young
                as citizens.</p>
                            <p>This training must, of necessity, be of a specific kind; for, like other small
                communities, the Greek city-states showed a life fundamentally one in conception,
                under various specific forms. Each state had its special character, and to this
                character the education given in it must conform if it were to be an effective
                instrument for training the citizens. From these fundamental conceptions flowed the
                demands of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name>
                and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>
                that education should be regulated in all its details by the state authority, should
                be compulsory on all free citizens, and should be uniform—at any rate in its earlier
                stages—for all. In <bibl>

                of some of the most pertinent facts of life. For the guardian-citizens of the ideal
                state family life and family ties are abolished; no lower community is to be allowed
                to enter into competition with the state. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, indeed, did not go
                to these extreme lengths; he allowed the family to remain, but he seems to have
                regarded it as likely to affect children more for evil than for good.</p>
                            <p>In the essential principles laid down by both philosophers as to the relation of
                the state to education, and in the corollaries they drew from that relation, they
                were not at variance with the accepted Greek theory on the subject. It is true that
                the actual practice of Greek states departed,-and often widely, from this ideal,
                for, especially in later centuries, the Greek always tended to live his own life.
                The nearest approach to the theory was found in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta">Sparta</name>, where the end of the state
                as a military organization was kept steadily in view, and where, after early
                childhood, the young citizens were trained directly by the state in a kind of
                barrack life—the boys to become warriors, the girls the mothers of warriors. It was
                this feature of Spartan education, together with the rude simplicity of life it

                the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name>

                under the ephebic age there was no practical regulation of schools or palaestra by
                the state. Yet there is no doubt that the education really given was in conformity
                with Athenian ideals of culture and life, and that it was generally received by the
                children of free citizens, though of course the sons of the wealthy, then as now,

                defect of Athenian education was in reality its strongest point. In practice, the
                harmony between individual liberty and social claims was much more nearly attained
                under a system of free working out of common thoughts and ideals than would have

                games which form so important a feature in the school life of modern England. The
                  <q>"musical"</q> training was essentially in the national literature and music of
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name>,
                and this could obviously be carried to very different lengths. The elements of
                mathematical science were also commonly taught. The essential purpose throughout was
                the development of the character of a loyal citizen of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name>. As Athenian culture
                advanced, increasing attention was paid to diagogic studies, especially in the
                ephebic age, with a corresponding decrease of attention to merely physical pursuits;
                hence the complaints of such satirists as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</name> of a growing
                luxury, effeminacy and corruption of youths: complaints apparently based on a
                comparison of the worst features of the actual present with an idealized and
                imaginative picture of the virtues of the past. Such comparison is, indeed, implicit
                in much of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name>
                and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>
                as well as in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</name>.</p>
                            <p>But a disintegrating force was already at work in the educational system of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> which
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> vainly
                opposed. This was the rhetorical training of the Sophists, the narrowly practical
                and individualistic aim of which was entirely out of harmony with the older Greek
                ideals of life and culture. In a democratic city-state the orator easily became a
                demagogue, and generally oratory was the readiest path to influence and power. Thus
                oratory opened the way to personal ambition, and young men who were moved by that
                passion eagerly attended the Sophist schools where their dominant motive was
                strengthened.</p>
                            <p>Further, the closer relations between the Greek states, both in nearer and farther
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Hellas</name>,
                led naturally to the diminution of differences between civic ideals, and, as a
                consequence, to a more cosmopolitan conception of higher education. This process was
                completed by the loss of political independence of the city-states under the
                Macedonian domination. Henceforth, higher education became purely intellectual, and
                its relation to political and social life increasingly remote. This, combined with
                the growing rhetorical tendency already noticed, accounts for the sterility of Greek
                thought during the succeeding centuries. The means of higher education were, indeed,
                more fully organized. The university of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name> was the outcome of a fusion
                of the private philosophical schools with the state organization for the training of
                the ephebi, and there were other such centres of higher culture, especially in after
                years at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name>, where the contact of Greek thought with the religions and
                philosophies of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</name> and the East gave birth in time to the more or less mystical
                philosophies which culminated in Neo-platonism. But at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name> itself thought became more
                and more sterile, and education more and more a mere training in unreal rhetoric,
                till the dissolution of the university by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Justinian_I">Justinian</name> in A.D. 529.</p>

                had lost that reality which is drawn from intimate relation to civic life, and the
                fashionable individualistic schools of philosophy could do nothing to replace the
                loss. It was, then, an education which had largely lost its life-springs that was
                transferred to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>. In the earlier centuries of the republic, Roman education was given
                entirely in family and public life. The father had unlimited power over his son's
                life, and was open to public censure if he failed to train him in the ordinary
                moral, civic and religious duties. But it is doubtful if there were any schools
                (q.v.), and it is certain there was no national literature to furnish an instrument
                of culture. A Roman boy learnt to reverence the gods, to read, to bear himself well
                in manly exercises, and to know enough of the laws of his country to regulate his
                conduct. This last he acquired directly by hearing his father decide the cases of
                his clients every morning in his hall. The rules of courtesy he learnt similarly by
                accompanying his father to the social gatherings to which he was invited. Thus early
                Roman education was essentially practical, civic and moral, but its intellectual
                outlook was extremely narrow.</p>

                            <p>When a wider culture was imported from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> it was, however,
                the form rather than the spirit of true Hellenic education that was transferred.
                This was, indeed, to some extent inevitable from the decadent state of Greek
                education at the time, but it was accentuated by the essentially practical character
                of the Roman mind. The instrument of education first introduced was Greek
                literature, much of which was soon translated into Latin. In time the schools of the
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                    <hi rend="italic">grammatici</hi>
                                </foreign>, teaching grammar and literature, were supplemented by schools of
                rhetoric and philosophy, though the philosophy taught in them was itself little more
                than rhetorical declamation. These furnished the means of higher culture for those
                youths who did not study at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name> or <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name>, and were also
                preparatory to studies at those universities. Under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Empire</name> the rhetorical
                schools were gradually organized into a state system, the general principles of
                administration being laid down by imperial decree, and even such details as the
                appointment and rate of payment of the professors, at first left to the
                municipalities, being in time assumed by the central government. There is no
                evidence of any state regulation or support of the lower schools. This widening of
                culture affected both boys and girls, the domestic education of the latter being
                supplemented by a study of literature. But it is the higher training in rhetoric
                which is especially characteristic of Hellenized Roman education.</p>

                                </bibl>, the most systematic treatise on education produced by the ancient world.
                With <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian">Quintilian</name> the ideal of an orator was a widely cultured, wise and
                honourable man. And at first the teaching of rhetoric undoubtedly made for higher
                and true culture. But with the autocracy, soon passing into tyranny, of the empire,
                rhetoric ceased to be a preparation for real life. The true function of oratory is
                to persuade a free people. When it cannot be applied to this purpose it becomes
                little more than a means of intellectual frivolity, or, at the best, an exhibition
                of cultured ingenuity. Under the empire a rhetorical training was, indeed, turned in
                not a few instances to practical but most unworthy uses by the delators ; a result
                made possible by the legal system which rewarded delation with a considerable
                portion of the estate of the condemned. Even apart from this, the education in
                rhetoric had an increasingly evil effect both on the culture and on the character of
                the higher classes in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman empire</name>. Out of
                real connexion with life as it was, it sought its subjects in the realms of the
                fanciful and the trivial, and with unreality of topic went of necessity
                deterioration of style. The vivid presentment of living thought gave way to that
                inflated and bombastic abuse of meretricious ornament and far-fetched metaphor in
                which human speech is always involved when it sets forth ideas, or shadows of ideas,
                which grow out of no conviction in the speaker and are expected to carry no
                conviction to the hearer. Imitation of the form of great models, without the
                substance of thought which underlay them, led to a general unreality and essential
                falseness of mental life. Further, the continual gazing with admiration on the
                productions of the past, and the conception of excellence as consisting in closeness
                of imitation, induced a servile attitude of mind towards authority in all too close
                agreement with the political servility which marked the Roman court. Such an
                attitude was essentially hostile to mental initiative, and thus rhetoric became not
                merely an art of expression but a type of character.</p>
                            <p>Nor was there anything in the general conditions of society to counterbalance the
                ill effects of school and university education. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian">Quintilian</name> lamented that, even
                in his time, the old Roman family education by example was corrupted; and the moral
                degradation of later times, though it has doubtless been exaggerated, was certainly
                real and widespread. Nor does the <pb n="954" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0954.png"/> religious revival of Paganism which
                synchronized with the early centuries of Christianity appear to have effected any
                reform in life. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name>, the birthplace of Neo-platonism and the intellectual centre of
                the later empire, was also a very sink of moral obliquity.</p>

                            <p>It was into such a decaying civilization, which by its want of vitality sterilized
                education, oppressing it under the weight of a dead tradition, that Christianity
                brought new life. Of course, careful instruction in the Faith was given in
                catechetical schools, of which that at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name> was the most
                famous. But the question as to the attitude of Christians towards the ordinary
                classical culture was important. On the one hand, literature was saturated with
                Paganism, and the Pagan festivals formed a regular part of school life. On the other
                hand, the Pagan education offered the only means of higher culture, and thus
                furnished the only weapon with which Christians could successfully meet their
                controversial antagonists. Quite at first, no doubt, when the converts to the new
                faith were few and obscure, the question scarcely arose; but as men of culture and
                position were attracted to the Church it became urgent. The answers given by the
                Christian leaders were various, and largely the outcome of temperament and previous
                training. The Greek Fathers, especially <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clement_of_Alexandria">Clement of
                  Alexandria</name> (150-217) and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Origen">Origen</name> (185-253), regarded
                Christianity as essentially the culmination of philosophy, to which the way must be
                found through liberal culture. Without a liberal education the Christian could live
                a life of faith and obedience but could not attain an intellectual understanding of
                the mysteries of the Faith. On the other hand, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tertullian">Tertullian</name> (160-240) was very
                suspicious of Pagan culture; though he granted the necessity of employing it as a
                means of education, yet he did so with regret, and would forbid Christians to teach
                it in the public schools, where some recognition of Paganism would be implied. The
                general practice of the Christians, however, did not conform to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tertullian">Tertullian</name>'s exhortations.
                Indeed, many of the cultivated Christians of the 3rd and 4th centuries were little
                more than nominal adherents to the Faith, and the intercourse between Christian and
                Pagan was often close and friendly. The general attitude of Christians towards the
                traditional education is evidenced by the protest raised against the edict of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julian_the_Apostate">Julian</name>,
                which forbade them to teach in the public schools. The ultimate outcome seems to be
                fairly expressed in the writings of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_of_Hippo">St Augustine</name> (354-430)
                and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerome">St Jerome</name>
                (346-420), who held that literary and rhetorical culture is good so long as it is
                kept subservient to the Christian life.</p>
                            <p>In another way Greek philosophy exercised an abiding influence over the culture of
                future ages. The early centuries of Christianity felt the need of formulating the
                Faith to preserve it from disintegration into a mass of fluid opinions, and such
                formulation was of necessity made under the influence of the philosophy in which the
                early Fathers had been trained—that Neo-platonism which was the last effort of
                Paganism to attain a conception of life and of God. In the West, this formulation
                had to be translated into Latin, for Greek was no longer generally understood in
                Italy, and thus the juristic trend of Roman thought also became a factor in the
                exposition of Christian doctrine. This formulation of the Faith was one of the chief
                legacies the transition centuries passed on to <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>.</p>
                            <p>Had classical culture been less formal than it was during the early centuries of
                Christianity, the innate antagonism of the Pagan and Christian views of life and
                character must have been so apparent that the education which prepared for the one
                could not have been accepted by the other. It was only because rhetorical culture
                was so emphatically intellectual, and so little, if at all, moral in its aims, that
                its inherent opposition to the Christian conception of character was not obvious.
                That its antagonistic influence was not inoperative is shown by the not infrequent
                perversions of cultured Christians to Paganism. But generally the opposition was so
                obscured that the ethical writings of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ambrose">St Ambrose</name> (340-397) are largely
                Stoic in conception and reasoning. Yet the Pagan ideal of life, especially as it had
                been developed in the individualistic ethics which had prevailed for more than six
                centuries, was antithetical in essence to that of the Christian Church. The former
                was essentially an ethics of self-reliance and self-control showing itself in
                moderation and proportion in all expressions of life. An essential feature in such a
                character was high-mindedness and a self-respect which was of the nature of pride.
                On the contrary, Christian teaching exalted humility as one of the highest virtues,
                and regarded pride and self-confidence as the deadliest of sins. It recognized no
                doctrine of limitation; what was to be condemned could not be abhorred too
                violently, nor could what was good be too strongly desired or too ardently sought.
                The highest state attainable by man was absorption in loving ecstasy in the mystic
                contemplation of God. The practical attempt to realize this gave rise to
                monasticism, with its minutely regulated life expressing unlimited obedience and the
                renunciation of private will at every moment. The monastic life was regarded as the
                nearest approach to the ideal which a Christian could make on earth. Naturally, as
                this conception gathered strength in generations nurtured in it, the value of
                classical culture became less and less apparent, and by the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_I">St Gregory the
                  Great</name> (d. 604) the use of classical literature except as means of an
                education having quite another end than classical culture was discouraged.</p>

                            <p>Of course, during these centuries, the gradual subjugation of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Roman_Empire">the
                  western empire</name> by the barbarians had been powerfully operative in the
                obscuring of culture. Most of the public schools disappeared, and generally the
                light of learning was kept burning only in monasteries, and in them more and more
                faintly as they became more or less isolated units exposed to attack by ruthless
                foes or living in continual dread of such attack. Though the barbarians absorbed the
                old culture in various degrees of imperfection, yet the four centuries following the

                  Augustine</name> were plunged in intellectual darkness, relieved by transitory

                could be done was to preserve to some extent the heritage of the past. This, indeed,

                            <p>During these same centuries another process had been advancing with accelerating
                steps. This was the modification of the Latin language. In the early centuries of
                Christianity literary Latin was already very different from colloquial Latin,
                especially in the provinces; and, as has been said, the literary output of the last
                age of Paganism was marked by sterility of thought and meretricious redundancy of
                expression. On the other hand, the writings of Christianity show a real living force
                seeking to find appropriate expression in new forms. Thus, with Christian writers,
                slavish imitation of the past gradually gave way to the evolution of a new and
                living Latin, which showed itself more and more regardless of classical models. To
                express the new ideas to which Christianity gave birth fresh words were coined, or
                borrowed from colloquial speech or from the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures. This
                Christian Latin was a real living instrument of expression, which conformed itself
                in its structure much more closely to the mode of thought and expression of actual
                life than did the artificial imitation of antiquity in which the literary
                productions of Paganism were clothed. It is the Latin in which <bibl>

                current Latin became more and more oblivious of even such elements of form as
                grammatical inflexions and concords.</p>

                  Carolingian revival</name> addressed itself. The movement was essentially

                educational adviser and chief executive officer in scholastic matters, was probably
                the best scholar of his time, and himself loved the classical writings with which he
                was acquainted , but the text-books he wrote were but imperfect summaries of
                existing compendia, and the intellectual condition of his pupils forbade a very
                generous literary diet even had he thought it desirable, of which there is some
                doubt. The most valuable outcome of the movement was the establishment <pb n="955" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0955.png"/> of the palace school, and of
                bishops' schools and monastic schools throughout the empire. Of these the latter
                were the most important, and each of the chief monasteries had from the time of
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name> an external school for pupils not proposing to enter the order
                as well as an internal school for novices. Thus, the educational system north of the
                Alps was pre-eminently ecclesiastical in its organization and profoundly religious
                in its aims. For two centuries the new intellectual life was obscured by the
                troubled times which followed the death of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name>, but the learning
                which <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carolingian_Renaissance">the Carolingian revival</name> had restored was preserved here and there in
                cathedral and monastic schools, and the sequence of well-educated ecclesiastics was
                never altogether interrupted.</p>

                            <p>The scope of the arts was wider than their names would suggest in modern times.
                Under grammar was included the study of the content and form of literature; and in
                practice the teaching varied from a liberal literary culture to a dry and
                perfunctory study of just enough grammar to give some facility in the use of Latin.
                Dialectic was mainly formal logic. Rhetoric covered the study of law, as well as
                composition in prose and verse. Geometry was rather what is now understood by
                geography and natural history, together with the medicinal properties of plants.
                Arithmetic, with the cumbrous Roman notation, included little more than the simplest
                practical calculations required in ordinary life and the computation of the
                calendar. Music embraced the rules of the plain-song of the Church, some theory of
                sound, and the connexion of harmony and numbers. Astronomy dealt with the courses of
                the heavenly bodies, and was seldom kept free from astrology. In philosophy the

                            <p>There were thus two broad stages in the educational revival commonly known as
                scholasticism. In the first the controversies were essentially metaphysical, and
                centred round the question of the nature of universals; the orthodox theological
                party generally supporting realism, or the doctrine that the universal is the true
                reality, of which particulars and individuals are only appearances ; while the
                opposite doctrine of nominalism—that universals are <q>" mere sounds "</q> and
                particulars the only true existences—showed a continual disposition to lapse into
                heresies on the most fundamental doctrines of the Church. The second stage was
                essentially constructive; the opposition of philosophy to theology was negated, and
                philosophy gave a systematic form to theology itself. The most characteristic figure
                of the former period was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Abelard">Abelard</name> (1079-1142), of the
                latter <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Aquinas">St
                  Thomas Aquinas</name> (1225-1274). The former knew little of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> beyond the
                translations and adaptations of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anicius_Manlius_Severinus_Boethius">Boethius</name>, but he was essentially a dialectician who applied his logic to
                investigating the fundamental doctrines of the Church and bringing everything to the
                bar of reason. This innate rationalism appeared to bring theology under the sway of
                philosophy, and led to frequent condemnations of his doctrines as heretical. With
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Aquinas">St
                  Thomas</name>, on the other hand, the essential dogmas of Christianity must be
                unquestioned. In his <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Summa_Theologica">

                            <p>It is evident, then, that during the period of the scholastic revival, men's
                interests were specially occupied with questions concerning the spiritual and the
                unseen, and that the great instrument of thought was syllogistic logic, by which
                consequences were deduced from premises received as unquestionably true. There was a
                general acceptance of the authority of the Church in matters of belief and conduct,
                and of that of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, as approved by the Church, in all that related to knowledge of

                barrenness of a training confined to the subtleties of formal logic. But the
                recrudescence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> accelerated the movement in favour of dialectic, though at the
                same time it furnished topics on which logic could be exercised which only a bare
                materialism can esteem unimportant. The weaknesses of the general educational system
                which grew up within scholasticism were that haste to begin dialectic led to an
                undue curtailment of previous liberal culture, and that exclusive attention to
                philosophical and theological questions caused a neglect of the study of the
                physical world and a disregard of the critical functions of the intellect. Doubtless
                there were exceptions, of which perhaps the most striking is the work in physical
                science done at Oxford by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Bacon">Roger Bacon</name> (1214-1294). But
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albertus_Magnus">Albertus
                  Magnus</name> (1193-1280), the master of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Aquinas">St Thomas</name>, was also a
                student of nature and an authority for his day on both the natural and the physical
                sciences. And the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Grosseteste">Grosseteste</name> (d. 1253),

                Always there were such examples. But too often boys hastened to enter upon dialectic
                and philosophy as soon as they had acquired sufficient smattering of colloquial
                Latin to engage in the disputes of the schools. A deterioration of Latin was the
                unavoidable consequence of such premature specialization. The seven liberal arts
                were often not pursued in their entirety, and students remained satisfied with
                desiccated compendia of accepted opinions. Thus the encyclopaedias of general
                information which were in general use during <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> show little
                or no advance in positive knowledge upon the treatment of similar subjects in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isidore_of_Seville">Isidore of

                            <p>The services of scholasticism to the cause of education, however, cannot well be
                overestimated, and the content of scholastic studies was in fundamental harmony with
                the intellectual interests of the time. Above all other benefits owed by future ages
                to scholasticism is the foundation of the universities of western Europe. The
                intellectual activity of the 11th century led everywhere to a great increase in the
                number of scholars attending the monastic and cathedral schools. Round famous
                teachers, such as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Abelard">Abelard</name>, gathered crowds of
                students from every country. In the 12th century the need for organizing such bodies
                of teachers and students was imperative, and thus the earlier universities arose in
                Italy, France and England, not by deliberate foundation of secular or ecclesiastical
                ruler, but as spontaneous manifestations of the characteristic medieval impulse to
                organize into institutions. Afterwards, charters conferring powers and privileges
                were sought from both Church and state, but these only confirmed the selfgoverning
                character the universities had borne from the first. Each of the early universities
                was a specialized school of higher study: <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Salerno">Salerno</name> was a
                school of medicine; <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Bologna">Bologna</name> was the
                centre of that revival of Roman law which wrought so profound an effect upon the
                legal systems of France and Germany towards the close of the medieval period. But
                the greatest of medieval universities was that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>, emphatically the home of
                philosophy and theology, which was the model upon which many other universities,
                including <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Cambridge">Cambridge</name>, were organized.</p>
                            <p>The German universities were of later origin, the earliest being <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_University_in_Prague">Prague</name> (1348) and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Vienna">Vienna</name> (1365). They
                indicate the more recognized position the movement had attained ; for nearly all
                were founded by the civic authority, and then obtained the recognition of the Church
                and charters from the emperor.</p>

                            <p>The concentration of higher instruction in universities was not antagonistic to the
                medieval conception of the Church as the teacher of mankind. University life was
                modelled on that of the closter, though the monastic ideal could not be fully
                realized, and the scholars not infrequently exhibited considerable licence in life.
                This was inevitable with the very large numbers of the scholars and the great
                variations of age among them. Moreover students, and to a less extent teachers,
                passed from university to university, so that the universities of medieval Europe
                formed a free confederacy of learning in close relation to the Church but
                untrammelled by state control. Nevertheless, they were less definitely
                ecclesiastical than the cathedral seminaries which they largely supplanted, and the
                introduction of studies derived from <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> through <name type="people">the Arabians</name> led to an increased freedom of thought, at first
                within authorized limits, but prepared, when occasion served, to transcend those
                limits.</p>
                            <p>The scheme of instruction was arranged on the assumption that special studies
                should be based on a wide general culture. Thus of the four faculties into which
                university teaching was organized, that of arts, with its degrees of Baccalaureat
                and Magister, was regarded as propaedeutic to those of theology, law and medicine.
                It often included, indeed, quite young boys, for the distinction between grammar
                school and university was not clearly drawn. Attention was concentrated on those
                subjects which treat of man and his relations to his fellow-men and to God, and no
                attempt was made to extend the bounds of knowledge. The aim was to pass on a body of
                acquired knowledge regarded as embracing all that was possible of attainment, and
                the authority of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> in physics as well as in philosophy, and of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galen">Galen</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippocrates">Hippocrates</name> in medicine was
                absolute. The methods of instruction—by lecture, or commentary on received texts;
                and by disputation, in which the scholars acquired dexterity in the use of the
                knowledge they had absorbed—were in harmony with this conception, and were
                undoubtedly thoroughly well suited to the requirements of an age in which the ideal
                of human thought was not discovery but order, and in which knowledge was regarded as
                a set of established propositions, the work of reason being to harmonize these
                propositions in subordination to the authoritative doctrines of the Church.</p>

                            <p>Such an extension of the means of higher education as was given by the universities
                was naturally accompanied by a corresponding increase in schools of lower rank. Not
                only were there grammar schools at cathedral and collegiate churches, but many
                others were founded in connexion with chantries, and by some of the many gilds into
                which medieval middle-class life organized itself. The Dominican and Franciscan
                friars were enthusiastic promoters of learning both in universities and in schools,
                and in the Netherlands <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brethren_of_the_Common_Life">the Brethren of the

                the promotion of learning by the multiplication of manuscripts as another. The
                curriculum was represented broadly by the <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                </foreign>. The greatest attention was paid to grammar, which included very various
                amounts of reading of classical and Christian authors, the most commonly included
                being <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virgil">Virgil</name>,

                disputations.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the grammar schools were writing and song schools of an elementary
                type, in which instruction was usually in the vernacular. Girls were taught in
                women's monasteries and in the home, and those of the upper classes at least very
                generally learned to read, write and keep accounts, as well as fine needlework,
                household duties and management, and such elementary surgery and medicine as served
                in cases of slight daily accidents and illnesses. Even those boys and girls who did
                not receive formal scholastic instruction were instructed orally by the parish
                priests in the doctrines and duties of the Faith ; while the pictures and statues
                with which the churches were adorned aided the direct teaching of sermons and
                catechizing in giving a general knowledge of <title>Bible</title> history and of the
                legends of the saints.</p>
                            <p>No doubt, in times of spiritual and intellectual lethargy, the practice fell short
                of the theory ; but on the whole it may be concluded that in medieval times the
                provision for higher instruction was adequate to the demand, and that, relatively to
                the culture of the time, the mass of the people were by no means sunk in brutish
                ignorance. Indeed, especially when the paucity of books before the invention of
                printing is borne in mind, the number of people who could read the vernacular, as
                evidenced by the demand for books in the vulgar tongue as soon as printing made them
                available, is clear proof that the latter part of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> was by no
                means a time of general illiteracy.</p>

                performance of its duties. This was the training in chivalry given to pages and

                sanctified by the offices of the Church. The education of chivalry aimed at fitting
                the noble youth to be a worthy knight, a just and wise master, and a prudent manager
                of an estate. Much was acquired by daily experience of a knightly household, but in
                addition the page received direct instruction in reading and writing; courtly
                amusements, such as chess and playing the lute, singing and making verses; the rules
                and usages of courtesy; and the knightly conception of duty. As a squire he
                practised more assiduously the knightly exercises of war and peace, and in the
                management of large or small bodies of men he attained the capacity of command.</p>

                            <p>With the unification of existing knowledge and the systematization of theology the
                constructive work of scholasticism was done. At the same time the growth of national
                feeling was slowly but surely undermining feudalism. Moreover, deep resentment was
                accumulating throughout western Europe against the practical abuses which had become
                prevalent in the Church, and especially in the court of Rome and in the
                prince-bishoprics of Germany. In short, Europe was out-growing medieval
                institutions, which appeared more and more as empty forms unable to satisfy the
                needs and longings of the human soul. In such conditions, the customary and
                traditional education of school and university tended to lose touch more and more
                completely with the new aspirations and views of life which were everywhere
                gathering adherents among the keenest and most active intellects. Had a new cultural
                movement not begun, the education of Europe threatened to become as arid as the
                rhetorical education of the last centuries of the Roman empire had been. From this

                empire, was the seed-plot of this new tree of knowledge. Ever since the 11th century
                the cities of northern Italy had been in advance of Europe beyond the Alps both in
                culture and in material progress. The old classical spirit and the feeling of Roman
                citizenship had never quite died out, and <bibl>the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_Comedy">

                                </bibl> (1265-1321) furnishes evidence that the poet of the scholastic philosophical
                theology was also a keen student and lover of the old Latin poets. But the greatest
                impulse to the revived study of the classics was given by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrarch">Petrarch</name> (1304-1374) and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Boccaccio">Boccaccio</name> (1313-1375). Generally throughout western Europe the 14th
                century, though full of war and political unrest, was a time of considerable
                intellectual activity, shown in the increase of schools and universities, as well as
                in the literary and artistic revival in Italy, in the social and theological
                movement in England and Bohemia associated with the names of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Wycliffe">Wycliffe</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jan_Hus">Huss</name>, and in the
                more or less perfect substitution of Roman law everywhere except in England for the
                law of custom which had hitherto prevailed.</p>
                            <p>But it was the literary movement which most affected education, and indeed the
                whole life of Europe. A decisive step was taken when <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manuel_Chrysoloras">Manuel Chrysoloras</name> was
                invited to teach Greek in <name type="institution">the university of Florence</name>
                in 1397. The enthusiasm for classical culture, to which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrarch">Petrarch</name> had given so great an
                impetus, fathered force and extended over the whole of Italy, though, of course,
                felt only by a select few and leaving the mass of the people little, if at all,
                affected. From Italy it spread gradually to countries north of the Alps. In the old
                writers men found full expression of that new spirit of self-conscious freedom which
                was vaguely striving for expression throughout the whole of Christendom. In the free
                political atmosphere of the Italian communes, with their wealthy and leisured
                merchant class, that spirit could flourish much more readily than in the feudalized
                Europe across the Alps. Moreover, the antique spirit was in direct line of ancestry
                with that of medieval Italy. Thus, for a couple of centuries, Italy stood in the van
                of European culture.</p>
                            <p>The stages of the movement cannot be traced here: suffice it to say it showed
                itself especially in an enthusiastic search for manuscripts, followed by their
                multiplication and wider distribution; in an intense devotion to literary form; in a
                revival of classic taste in architecture; in a wonderful development of painting and
                sculpture from symbolism of spiritual qualities towards naturalism and romanticism ;
                in a return to Platonism in philosophy; in a contempt, often unreasoning and wanting
                a foundation in knowledge, for the scholastic Aristotelian philosophy itself, and
                not simply for the trivialities into which its actual exercise had so commonly
                degenerated. The invention of printing necessarily gave the movement both a stronger
                and a wider influence than it could otherwise have attained. And in its search after
                knowledge it was in full harmony with the spirit of adventure which marked the age,
                and by the discovery of the New World wrought so profound a change in the relative
                importance and prosperity of the countries of western Europe.</p>

                            <p>It is the spirit of the movement which is of interest to the student of education.
                And that spirit was essentially one of opposition to authority and of assertion of
                individual liberty, which worked itself out in various forms among peoples of
                different temperaments. In Italy the form was literary and artistic, and the full
                development of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">the
                  Renaissance</name> spirit was seen in a practical Paganism which substituted the
                attractions of art for the claims of religion and morality, and eventuated in deep
                and widespread immorality and a contemptuous tolerance of the outward observances of
                religion without faith in the doctrines they symbolized. The movement became an
                attempt to reconstitute the past intellectual life of Italy, and, as such, was
                foredoomed to sterility as soon as the work of re-discovery was completed; for the
                revived forms were not inspired with the vital spirit which had once made them
                realities, and consequently men's minds once again were occupied with mere verbal
                subtleties. The really valuable service of the Italian humanists to Europe was the
                restoration to man of the heritage of knowledge which he had allowed to slip from
                his grasp, and the leading the way to a freer intellectual atmosphere. In Germany
                the spirit manifested itself in a rebellion against the doctrinal system of the
                Church as the only effectual means of attaining reform of ecclesiastical abuses. The
                Protestant reformation of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> was the real German
                outcome of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">the
                  Renaissance</name>. In no other country of Europe did the movement take so
                distinctive a form.</p>
                            <p>It was, then, not merely the revival of interest in classical studies which so
                profoundly affected the life and education of western Europe. It was rather that in
                those literatures men found a response to intellectual and moral cravings which had
                been blindly gathering force for generations, and which found themselves formulated
                and objectified in the writings which set forth the Pagan view of life with its
                assumption of the essential worth and self-reliance of the individual and its frank
                delight in all the pleasures of existence. It was, in short, in proportion as men
                not only found delight in Pagan literature but returned in essence to the Pagan view
                of individual worth and the supremacy of the human intellect, that the Church
                realized the danger to herself which lurked in the new movement.</p>
                            <p>At first the revival of interest in the classical literatures did not show any
                antagonism to Catholic faith and practice, and its warmest supporters were faithful
                sons of the Church. The view of the relation of classical literature to Christianity
                adopted by the great humanist schoolmaster <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vittorino_da_Feltre">Vittorino da Feltre</name>
                (1378-1446) was broadly that of the early Fathers, and in his school at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantua">Mantua</name> he showed that
                culture was not inconsistent with loyalty to the Church or with purity of life. With
                him classical literature was not the end and sum of education, but was a means of
                implanting ideas, of developing taste, and of acquiring knowledge, all as helps and
                ornaments of a Christian life. Though Pagan literature was the means of education,
                the Pagan spirit had not supplanted that of Christianity. The school at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantua">Mantua</name> may, indeed,
                be said to have exhibited in practice a Christianized application of the doctrines
                of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian">Quintilian</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch">Plutarch</name>.</p>
                            <p>So was it in the other countries of Christendom. In the Netherlands <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brethren_of_the_Common_Life">the Brethren of the Common Life</name> introduced humanistic studies into their
                schools side by side with definite religious teaching and observances and their work
                was always <pb n="958" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0958.png"/> dominated by
                the Christian spirit. The earlier German humanists, such as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_of_Kues">Nicholas de Cusa</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Hegius_von_Heek">Hegius</name>, <name type="person">Agricola</name>

                  Alexey Gorobiy</note> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jakob_Wimpfeling">Wimpheling</name>, adopted the
                same attitude, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desiderius_Erasmus">Erasmus</name> himself,
                bitteily as he attacked the practical abuses of the Church, remained in communion
                with it, and aimed at harmonizing classical culture with the Christian life. In
                England the same love of culture combined with devotion to the Church was seen in
                  <name type="person">Selling</name>, prior of <name type="institution">Christ
                  Church</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canterbury">Canterbury</name>, the first real English humanist, in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Grocyn">Grocyn</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Linacre">Linacre</name>,

                  <name type="person">Fisher</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Colet">Colet</name> and many others whose
                enthusiasm for culture was as undoubted as was their loyalty to Catholicism. It
                seemed, then, at first as if the greatest educational effect of the classical
                revival would be the deepening of literary culture, and the substitution of real
                inquiry for dialectic subtleties in the courses of schools and universities, without
                any break with established religious teaching. It is true that the majority of
                schools were but little affected, and many of the universities had given but a
                half-hearted welcome to humanistic studies when the religious revolt in Germany
                under the leadership of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> threw the whole of
                Europe into two hostile camps. But even the conservative <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris">university of Paris</name>
                —the headquarters of scholastic philosophical theology—had permitted the teaching of

That the influence of the new
                movement for classical study was gradually permeating the schools is shown not only
                by the practice of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brethren_of_the_Common_Life">the Brethren of the

                            <p>The immediate effect of the religious controversies of the 16th century on
                education was emphatically, if unintentionally, disastrous. The secularization of
                ecclesiastical property too often absorbed the endowments of the schools, so that,
                both in Germany and in England, the majority of grammar schools either disappeared
                or continued a starved existence with diminished funds; the doctrine of salvation by
                faith alone and the futility of good works dried up the source from which such
                endowments had flowed; the violent fulminations of the German reformers against the
                universities as the homes of the hated scholastic theology and philosophy found an
                echo in minds fired with the renaissance enthusiasm for poetry and oratory, and
                correlative distaste for the more severe and abstract speculations of logic and
                philosophy, which expressed itself in abstention from those seats of learning ; the
                preoccupation of men's minds with theological speculations and quarrels led those
                few who did resort to the universities to neglect their appointed studies and to
                devote their energies to interminable wrangling over the points in dispute. This
                decadence in culture was attended by an outbreak of licence and immorality,
                especially among the young, which called forth violent denunciations from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> and
                many of his followers in Germany, and from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Latimer">Latimer</name> and other reformers
                in England. In some respects these results were only transitory. Humanism and
                Protestantism, which had so far diverged that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desiderius_Erasmus">Erasmus</name> (1467-1536)
                had declared that where Lutheranism flourished learning decayed, were brought
                together again by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon">Melanchthon</name>
                (1497-156o) under whose influence universities were founded or reorganized and
                schools re-established in Protestant German states ; and in England the reign of

                            <p>Moreover, the schools established a tradition of curriculum and instruction which
                ignored the new directions of men's thoughts and the new view of knowledge as
                something to be enlarged, and not merely a deposit to be handed down from generation
                to generation. The later humanist theories of education, which the schools continued
                to follow generally for over two centuries, and in many cases for another hundred
                years after that, were drawn mainly from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desiderius_Erasmus">Erasmus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon">Melanchthon</name>, who found in the classical languages and literatures, and
                especially in Latin, the only essential instruments of education. General knowledge
                of natural facts might be desirable to the cultured man as ornaments to his
                rhetoric, but it was to be sought in the writings of antiquity. Even so
                revolutionary a thinker on education as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Rabelais">Rabelais</name> (1495-1553)
                with all his demand for an encyclopaedic curriculum, held the writings of the
                ancients as authoritative on natural phenomena. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon">Melanchthon</name>, whose
                conception of instruction was much narrower, exercised enormous influence in the
                moulding of Protestant universities and secondary schools, both directly and through

                but especially through his friend <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johannes_Sturm">Sturm</name> (1507-1589), whose
                Latin gymnasium at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strasbourg">Strassburg</name> became the model which the grammar schools of Protestant Europe
                strove to imitate. In this school nearly the whole of the energies of the boys was

                in 1534, brought back most of south Germany into the fold of the Church. Everywhere
                Catholic universities were mainly taught by Jesuit fathers ; and under their
                influence, scholasticism, purged from the excretions which had degraded it, was
                restored, and continued to satisfy the longings of minds which felt the need of an
                authoritative harmonizing of faith and knowledge. Everywhere the society established
                schools, which, by their success in teaching and the mildness of their discipline,
                attracted thousands of pupils who came even from Protestant homes. Their curriculum
                was purely classical, but it was elaborated with much skill, and the methods of
                instruction and discipline were made the subject of much thought and of
                long-continued experiment. In the methods thus determined all Jesuit fathers were
                trained, so that the teachers in Jesuit schools attained a degree of skill in their
                art which was too generally wanting elsewhere.</p>

                were not appropriated, the schools remained in harmony with the culture of their
                time, though, as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Mulcaster">Mulcaster</name> (1530-1611)
                pointed out, such a training was not of value to the majority of boys. For them he
                urged an elementary education in the vernacular; but neither in this nor in his
                advocacy of the training of teachers was his advice followed.</p>
                            <p>In the 17th century the dislocation between the Latin schools and the needs of life
                began to be accentuated as Latin gradually ceased to be the language of learning ;
                and, as a consequence, the numbers attending the schools decreased, and the mass of
                the people sunk continually lower in ignorance. In vain <name type="person">Hoole</name> urged the establishment of a universal system of elementary schools
                giving instruction in the vernacular, <name type="person">Petty</name> put forth his
                plan for elementary trade schools, and Cowley proposed the establishment of a
                college devoted to research. Ideas of reform were in the air, but the main current
                of scholastic practice flowed on unaffected by them. Some attention was, indeed,
                paid to the conservative reforms advocated by the Port Royalists, of which the most
                important was the inclusion of the vernacular as a branch of instruction, but the
                cry for more fundamental changes based on the philosophy of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> was unheeded. Of

                and won less adherence, though his school books, in which he attempted with very
                little success to apply his principles, were widely used in schools. But these were
                little more than bald summaries of real and supposed facts, stated in Latin and the
                vernacular in parallel columns. In content they differed from such medieval

                            <p>In the universities, too, the 16th and 17th centuries saw a continuous decadence.
                The 16th century was not ripe for real intellectual freedom; and Protestantism,
                having based its revolt on the right of private judgment, soon produced a number of
                conflicting theological systems, vying with each other in rigidity and narrowness,
                which, as <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Paulsen">Paulsen</name> says, <quote>" nearly stifled the intellectual life of the
                    German people."</quote>
                                </ref> Further, the idea of national autonomy, which exercised so great an effect on
                the politics of the time, included the universal adherence of the citizens to the
                religion of the state. Hence, till the end of the 17th century the universities of
                Protestant Europe were regarded mainly as instruments for securing adhesion to the
                national theological system on the part of future clergy and officials, and the
                state interfered more and more with their organization and work. Theology occupied
                the most important place in the higher studies pursued, which for the rest differed
                little in content and less in spirit from those of preceding centuries, except that
                more attention was paid to the study of classical literature. Even that decayed into
                formal linguistics as the Renaissance enthusiasm for poetry and oratory died out,
                and interest in logical and philosophical questions, fostered by the dominance of
                dogmatic controversial theology, again became dominant. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>, on the other hand, the
                faculty of theology had decayed through the withdrawal of those preparing for the
                priesthood into episcopal seminaries, and the higher studies pursued were mainly law
                and medicine. Thus, generally, the universities were less and less fulfilling the
                function of providing a general liberal education. Another change, due to the same
                causes and making for the same results, was the isolation of universities, often
                directly fostered by the state governments, which for the universal interchange of
                medieval thought substituted a narrow provincial culture and outlook. It is no
                wonder that numbers everywhere decayed and that complaints as to the habits of the
                students were loud and frequent.</p>

                            <p>At the close of the 17th century, then, universities as well as schools had reached
                a very low level of efficiency and were held in little respect by the cultured.
                Indeed, from the middle of the century, the main current of intellectual life had
                drifted away from the orthodox centres of learning. The formation of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences">the Berlin Academy</name> in Germany and of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Society">the Royal Society</name> in
                England, and the refusal of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gottfried_Leibniz">Leibnitz</name> to accept a
                chair in any German university, were signs of the times. In France, and later in
                Germany, the education of the noble youth was increasingly carried on apart from the
                schools, and was really an outgrowth from the education of chivalry. In the 16th
                century <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baldassare_Castiglione">Castiglione</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_de_Montaigne">Montaigne</name> had
                advocated a training directly adapted to prepare for polite life, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Elyot">Elyot</name> wrote on
                similar lines. But the most important movement in this direction was the formation
                of the courtly academies which flourished in France in the 17th century, and were
                soon imitated in the <foreign xml:lang="de">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Ritterakademien</hi>
                                </foreign> of Germany. In these schools of the nobility French was more honoured
                than classics, and the other subjects were chosen as directly adapted to prepare for
                the life of a noble at the court. <bibl>

                foreign travel had, from the middle of the 16th century, been looked upon as a
                better mode of finishing the education of a gentleman than a course at a
                university.</p>

                attention paid to mathematics and the physical sciences though the number of
                students continued very small. In Germany, also, a new era opened with the
                foundation of the universities of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Halle-Wittenberg">Halle</name>
                (1694) and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Göttingen">Göttingen</name> (1737),
                which from the first discarded the old conception that the function of a university
                is to pass on knowledge already complete, and so opened the door of the German
                universities to the new culture and philosophy. It was soon seen that students could
                thus be attracted, and the influence spread to the other German universities, which
                by the end of the 18th century had regained their position as homes of the highest
                German thought.</p>

                            <p>Rousseauism, however, was not merely a transitory revolt against a conventionality
                of life that had become unbearable ; it was emphatically the voicing of a view of
                life and of education which has profoundly influenced Europe ever since. In that
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> (1712-1778) attempted to look at life as a whole he was on truer

                    Enlightenment "</name>
                                </q> ; but in that he found the essence of life in the gratification of the desires
                and impulses of the moment, he enunciated a doctrine which banished high principle
                and strenuous effort from life and consequently from education. In the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emile:_or,_On_Education">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Emile</hi>
                                </title> is presented a purely fantastic scheme of education based on a psychology
                of development so crude as to be absolutely false, and producing a young man utterly
                unable to guide his own life or to control his emotions and impulses. Rousseauism
                is, indeed, in its essence the application to education of the doctrines of
                naturalism—the philosophy which regards human life as a mere continuation of
                physical process, and consequently as determined wholly by environment. So <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> would abolish all moral training and leave the child to the
                reactions of the physical world upon his actions.</p>

                                </title>, is essentially a protest. The most necessary element in education,

                And the supreme guide of life is the law of duly which is always more or less

                logical sequence, of the right of every child to be properly trained for life. The
                reaction due to the excesses of the revolutionists no doubt delayed the
                acknowledgment for a time, but its gradual recognition is emphatically the

                (1746-1827) in Switzerland, the general education of the poor was first made a
                reality by Prussia after the crushing defeat of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jena">Jena</name>. In France and England it
                remained for nearly threequarters of the century the work of the Church and other
                voluntary agencies, though aided by the state. Finally a state system of schools has
                been more or less fully set up in every state of western Europe and in America, and
                subjected to more or less state regulation and control. Equally marked has been the
                growing care for the scholastic education of girls as well as boys, though only in
                America are the two regarded as practically identical in form and content.</p>
                            <p>Thus the 19th century saw the final working out of the idea that the state should
                be substituted for the Church as the official agent of education, an idea which had
                its roots in the Renaissance conception of the right of man to direct his life apart
                from theological determinations. The more direct outcome of the same idea is
                apparent in the absolute liberty with which the presuppositions of knowledge are
                questioned, and the maxim of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/René_Descartes">Descartes</name>— to prove
                everything by the reason and to accept nothing which fails to stand the test—is
                acted upon. No greater contrast is possible than that between the medieval student
                and the modern searcher after truth.</p>

                            <p>The influence of the same spirit has wrought an equally momentous change in the
                methods of instruction. The impetus given by the exaggerated doctrine of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> to the view that the nature of the child should determine the
                means of education, led to more thorough-going attempts than had hitherto been made
                to base educational method on a knowledge of child psychology. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi">Pestalozzi</name> and
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Fröbel">Froebel</name> (1782-1852), by their insistence on the need of educating a child
                through his own activity, and by their widespread influence, made the new view of
                method an actuality. The influence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> has, thus,
                passed into modern educational practice in a form that, in its essence, is true,
                though in practice it has shown itself apt to run into the same excess of emphasis
                on impulse and feeling which vitiated the teaching of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> himself.
                The influence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Friedrich_Herbart">Herbart</name>
                (1776-1841) has tended to counteract this. The essence of Herbartianism is that
                mental life consists of presentations, or reactions of the mind on the environment,
                and that will springs from the circle of thought thus developed. The emphasis is
                therefore placed on intellect and instruction while in Froebelianism it is placed on
                spontaneous activity and on the arrangement of the environment. Each exaggerates the
                function of the one factor in concrete experience which it makes the centre of
                interest, and each is tinged with the individualistic conception of life which
                characterized the 18th and early 19th century.</p>

                            <p>The most marked change in the outward aspect of education has been the modification
                of the curriculum of school and university by the introduction of various branches
                of natural science. Conjointly with this has been much increase of specialization,
                and that not only in the university but in the school. There is no longer a
                universally recognized circle of knowledge constituting a liberal education
                preparatory to specialist studies, as there was in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. Nor is there
                general agreement as to what such educational institutions as schools and
                universities should attempt to do, or even as to the end that should be sought by
                education as a whole. Nor can agreement on such points be expected while men differ
                widely as to the meaning and purpose of life. The work of the organization of the
                material means of education has largely been accomplished by the civilized world:
                that of determining the true theory and practice of the educative process itself is
                still incomplete. To that, both discussion of the philosophy of life and of the
                relative values in life, of various kinds of experience and experiment in the light
                of the conclusions reached, are needed. The problem will never be absolutely solved,
                for that would imply an absolutely best education irrespective of conditions, but
                its practical solution will be reached when a true adjustment is made between the
                process of education and the life for which that education is intended to be a
                preparation.</p>

                governing the action of the state in relation to education may facilitate at the
                outset a clearer understanding of the problems which the organization of public
                education presents. The cardinal doctrine of state interference in the educational
                domain is universally accepted by all the great nations of the modern world; and in
                regard to its extent and limits a large measure of agreement has now been
                reached.</p>

                            <p>In the first place, it is recognized as the duty of the state to insist upon a
                certain minimum of education for every future citizen. This does not necessitate a
                monopoly of education on the part of the state, such as was claimed by the
                Napoleonic despotism under the traditional (it would seem) of the old authoritative
                Gallo-Roman tradition, transformed in its outward manifestation but not in its
                inward spirit by the French Revolution. Such a monopoly would be plainly repugnant
                to the spirit of Anglo- Saxon individualism, and it is interesting to note that
                attempts to reassert it have in recent times been repudiated in republican France by
                some of the best exponents of modern free thought, as an infringement of personal
                liberty not calculated to justify itself by any corresponding public gain.
                Nevertheless, the recognition of this primary duty of the state plainly implies a
                state system of at least elementary education. The masses of the industrial
                population cannot afford the necessary minimum of instruction which the public
                interest demands, and private and voluntary effort cannot efficiently supply the
                want resulting from the unequal distribution of wealth. But it is in the nature of
                things that, so far as private effort attempts anything in this direction, it should
                be motived in the main by religion and associated with the great historical
                religious organizations; thus it comes about that the moment the state steps in to
                make good the deficiency of voluntary effort a fruitful and embittering source of
                difficulty and friction is disclosed. Hence, in England, the history of public
                elementary education since the beginning of the 19th century has been very largely
                the history of what is called the religious difficulty. Here we find ourselves in
                the region of acute controversy in which it is useless to do more than note
                empirically the various solutions adopted by different states. Perhaps all that can
                safely be indicated as commanding universal acceptance is the principle that the
                state must not impose upon an individual citizen in the person of his child any form
                of religious instruction to which he conscientiously objects. Modern controversies
                show the difficulty of applying even this rudimentary principle to the complicated
                circumstances of a free community split up into a number of groups differing
                profoundly in religious sentiment, and zealous each for the recognition of its own
                ideal within the common system. So far, however, as secular instruction (i.e. the
                teaching of other subjects than religion) is concerned it is now generally accepted
                that the elementary minimum must be both compulsory and free for every individual
                child whose parents will not or cannot (as the case may be) provide such instruction
                for it efficiently elsewhere than in the state-supported schools.</p>
                            <p>Next, the action of the modern state cannot stop short at elementary education. The
                principle of <q>" the career open to talent "</q> is no longer a matter of abstract
                humanitarian theory, a fantastical aspiration of revolutionary dreamers ; for the
                great industrial communities of the modern world it is a cogent practical necessity
                imposed by the fierce international competition which prevails in the arts and
                industries of life. The nation that is not to fail in the struggle for commercial
                success, with all that this implies for national life and civilization, must needs
                see that its industries are fed with a constant supply of workers adequately
                equipped in respect both of general intelligence and technical training.</p>
                            <p>On political grounds too, the increasing democratization of <pb n="961" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0961.png"/> institutions renders a wide
                diffusion of knowledge and the cultivation of a high standard of intelligence among
                the people a necessary precaution of prudent statesmanship, especially for the great
                imperial states which confide the most-momentous issues of world policy to the
                arbitrament of the popular voice. The state then must satisfy itself that the means
                of education are placed within the reach of all, in grades adapted to the varying
                degrees of intelligence and educational opportunity to be found among a community
                upon the majority of whose members is imposed the necessity of entering upon the
                practical business of life at a more or less early age. The organization of the
                higher grades of education constitutes a task of less formidable magnitude than the
                organization of elementary education, for the reason that, at any rate in the
                prevailing social conditions, it is only a minority who can benefit by it, and that
                of this minority a large proportion can afford the whole or a considerable portion
                of the cost in each individual case. The class, however, whose education must needs
                be assisted by the state if it is not to remain inefficient must always be
                considerable ; and account must be taken also of the necessities of the further
                class whose exceptional mental development is such as to make it worth while for the
                state to bestow gratuitously an education higher than elementary at the public
                expense. University education is distinguished from education of the lower grades by
                the fact that, being necessarily restricted to an elite of intellect or birth, it
                cannot, save in very exceptional circumstances, usefully be organized locally.
                Although universities are the necessary complement of a public educational system
                they do not in strictness or necessity form part of such a system, and in so far as
                they are brought within the purview of public authority it must be as a matter of
                national, rather than municipal or provincial, concern. Accordingly university
                education is separately treated (see UNIVERSITIES), and will not be referred to,
                save incidentally, in the present article.</p>
                            <p>Reserving to a final section the history of education in the United States of
                America, a brief description is given here of the educational systems of the leading
                European countries by way of introduction to a more detailed, but still summary,
                historical sketch of public education in England. The highly organized educational
                systems of France and Prussia (as representing Germany) are manifestly suitable for
                the purposes of a general study of the principles of educational polity as worked
                out upon logical and consistently thought-out plans by highly centralized states. As
                to other European countries, a brief mention must suffice of certain features of
                special interest presented by smaller progressive states of such different types as
                Switzerland, Belgium and Holland. Similarly, in the case of the United Kingdom,
                considerations of space forbid more than a brief notice of the educational systems
                of Scotland (q.v.) and Ireland (q.v.). For other countries see the sections in the
                articles under the headings of the respective states.</p>

                                <p>France (q.v.) presents the most complete type of a state system of education
                  organized under a strongly centralized administration in all grades. This
                  centralized administration in education, as in other departments, represents the
                  Napoleonic heritage of the Republic, and, although there has been an increasing
                  tendency of recent years to study local conditions in the internal organization of
                  schools, anything approaching to local autonomy is unknown in educational affairs:
                  The necessary checks upon bureaucracy are supplied not by popularly elected
                  municipal bodies but by a strong infusion of the pedagogic element in the
                  administrative machinery. The pedagogic element in turn does but represent another
                  side of the collective activities of the state. The teaching profession both in
                  the primary and higher spheres— and the two are sharply marked off from one
                  another—consists of a highly organized body of state functionaries, united by a
                  strong <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                    </foreign> and actuated by ideals and aims which are inspired by the state. The
                  importance of this condition of things lies in the fact that the Republic is
                  something more than a form of government : it is the social and moral expression
                  of the democratic ideal as conceived by a people profoundly imbued by tradition
                  with the sense of social sohdarity, or collectivism; and nowhere has this
                  expression been more characteristic or more complete than in the domain of public
                  education. Yet the educational system of modern France is by no means exclusively

                  free school means a school not under state control and not forming part of the
                  state system.) In this as in much else the Revolution was powerless to do more
                  than enunciate general principles which it left for later generations, in the
                  present instance after the lapse of nearly a century, to carry into effect. True
                  to its theories of individualistic liberty, the Revolution admitted liberty of

                  twofold necessity. The wars of 1866 and 1870 were victories for the Prussian
                  schoolmaster, and aroused all western Europe to the national importance of popular
                  education. For France then the reform of popular education was an essential part
                  of the work of national restoration. For <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">the republic</name> too,
                  menaced by older and hostile traditions, the creation of a national system of
                  education inspired by its own spirit was an essential condition of the permanence
                  and security of its government and the social ideals of which that government was

                  set aside for this purpose by the state. In 1879 a law was passed compelling every

                  questions at issue must here suffice. As regards the character of the moral
                  instruction, it would appear to have shifted from a Kantian to a purely
                  sociological basis. Roman Catholic opinion is at least not unanimous in regarding
                  the <q>" lay "</q> or neutral school as essentially or necessarily anti-religious,
                  and plainly there is no inherent reason why the neutrality should not be a real
                  neutrality, but with the existing relations between the Catholic Church and modern
                  thought in France the influence of the Normalist teachers is in fact apt to be
                  anti-religious, and moreover no system of independent moral doctrine, whether
                  based upon a priori or inductive reasoning, can be acceptable to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the
                    Roman Catholic Church</name>. In whatever degree the blame may be rightly
                  apportionable between church and state, the fact is that the two find themselves
                  in acute conflict, and that from the conflict there has resulted a certain moral
                  confusion which Christian and non- Christian moralists alike view with alarm. It
                  may be that the mischief would have been mitigated had more moderate counsels
                  prevailed at the time of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Ferry">Ferry</name> law, and had the
                  church been willing to accept (as <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">the Republic</name>
                  might then have been willing to concede) right of entry for the clergy into the
                  schools. But the real causes of the trouble lie deep in the philosophical and
                  religious problems of our time, and in the constant and selfsacrificing devotion
                  of the French to logical ideals on either side. Perhaps it is not too sanguine to
                  discern in the growing tendency to idealism in French philosophy, and to liberal
                  ideas in French and Catholic religious thought, the promise of a happier state of
                  things. In the meantime, the religious difficulty in the schools divides the
                  nation into two hostile camps (<foreign xml:lang="fr">

                  1,298,591, as against 4,935,000 in the public primary schools, but these figures
                  were liable to be materially affected by the rigorous enforcement of the laws

                  state assumed the greater part of the burden of primary instruction, leaving to

                                <p>In proceeding to sketch the French system of higher primary and secondary
                  schools, it may be observed that European systems of higher education have
                  generally been framed upon the view that the divisions of education are
                  longitudinal, not latitudinal, and that secondary education is a training complete
                  in itself from the preparatory stage to the university, with aims and ideals of
                  general culture which differentiate it radically and at the very outset from
                  education of the elementary type. On the other hand, in the United States the view
                  has prevailed that the divisions of education must be latitudinal, that the
                  secondary school must be complementary to the elementary school, in which even the
                  elite must receive their preparatory or elementary training. At any rate down to
                  the reform of 1902, which will presently be explained, the French system could be
                  regarded as a typical and even extreme example of the European theory, little
                  consistent as this might seem to be with the broader principles of democracy. This
                  view of the matter is expressed by the French terminology, by which what in
                  England is called <q>" elementary "</q> is in France termed <q>"primary"</q>

                    Republic</name>. The aim of these schools is to fill the void which must
                  otherwise exist for those who need a higher education than the primary school can
                  give, but for whose subsequent careers secondary education would be ill-adapted
                  and injudicious. Throughout the organization of primary education the French have
                  kept steadily in view the danger of creating an intellectual proletariate. <quote>

                                    </quote> says an official report. The aim of the higher primary school is to
                  continue education in this spirit up to the age of sixteen so as to prepare the
                  scholar to take an honourable place in the higher ranks of skilled industry rather
                  than to deflect him towards a professional career or intellectual pursuits for
                  which he is unfitted, not so much by the accidents of birth and social
                  circumstance as by his own natural aptitudes. Within the limits necessarily marked
                  out for them the higher primary schools of France have aimed at imparting what may
                  be termed a general culture as distinct from purely technical or trade teaching,
                  and this development has been greatly furthered by the separate organization given
                  to the latter teaching in the <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                    </foreign>. At the same time, prominence is given in the higher primary schools to
                  practical training of an educational character with special reference to the
                  industries and circumstances of the locality, and in the rural districts a special
                  agricultural bias is imparted to the curriculum. It is interesting to note that
                  the institution of the higher primary schools was due in large part to the
                  spontaneous initiative of the municipalities, and that in the later phases of
                  state organization special care has been taken to avoid anything in the nature of
                  a rigid uniformity in these schools.</p>

                  school problem has recently commended itself to the consultative committee of

                                <p>Admission to the higher primary schools in France is only accorded to those who

                  the provision made for boarding scholars in attendance at these schools. The
                  boarding arrangements are generally, as in the case of the secondary schools, left
                  to the head teacher, but in some instances municipal hostels have been provided.
                  No fees may be charged for higher primary instruction, and scholarships (<foreign xml:lang="fr">

                  scholarships or maintenance allowances to compensate the parent for the loss of
                  the child's labour. The number of scholars in the public higher primary schools
                  for the year 1903- 1904 was 34,084, and in <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                  number of private secondary schools, the most important of which have been
                  associated with the Catholic religious orders. The enforcement of the laws against
                  these communities has resulted in the closure of a number of these schools, and in
                  the reorganization of others under a lay teaching staff. It is conceivable that

                  a matter of supply and demand is deeply rooted in the public mind. Proposals have

                  a school-leaving examination attached to the state schools. The adoption of any

                  affected by this process of laicization is far larger in the case of girls than of

                  practicable to pass a comprehensive education law, owing to the religious and
                  political difficulties with which any general legislative assertion of principle
                  is attended in Germany as in England. The consequence is that the Prussian system
                  in particular is the result of a long and complicated series of special laws,
                  decrees and administrative regulations. In such circumstances it is inevitable
                  that, especially in secondary education, some considerable local variations and
                  anomalies should remain, but the centralized authority of the state has confined
                  these to questions of patronage and external administration, and even within this
                  sphere has successfully asserted its own ultimate supremacy as the guardian of the
                  educational interests of its citizens. A detailed historical study would bring out
                  clearly the intimate connexion between the development of the educational system
                  and the growth of the Prussian state, and again between these and the expansion of
                  the national life of the German people; incidentally it would exhibit the
                  supremacy of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> in the modern Empire as the inevitable result not merely of
                  military force but of a genuine hegemony of intellect and culture.</p>

                                <p>Stress is rightly laid by all educational writers upon <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name>'s famous letter to
                  the German municipalities in 1524, urging upon them the duty of providing schools
                  and upon parents the duty of sending their children to school. An attempt to give
                  effect to this teaching was at once made by the electoral government of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saxony">Saxony</name>, which by a
                  school ordinance of 1528 provided for the establishment in every town and village
                  of Latin schools, for in Germany as in England the influence of the Protestant
                  reformers was solidly on the side of classical education as the key to the study
                  of the Scriptures and theological learning. All the more remarkable, therefore,
                  was the initiative of the electorate of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Württemberg">Württemberg</name>, whose school
                  ordinance of 1559 represents the first systematic attempt to make provision for
                  both elementary and higher education, directing that elementary schools should be
                  set up throughout the country, and <foreign xml:lang="de">

                  educational efforts both of the early Reformers and of the remarkable Jesuit
                  educationists, who contributed so largely to the partial reconquest of south
                  Germany for the Catholic Church, were brought to naught amid the troublous times
                  of the Thirty Years' War, and the desolation and national decadence which that
                  calamity brought in its train. To this result the aridity of the Protestant
                  scholastics who succeeded <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon">Melanchthon</name>, and the frivolity, incompetence and petty despotism of the
                  small German courts, contributed in no slight measure. The permanent and positive
                  value of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name>'s pronouncement of 1524 consists not so much in the direct
                  effects which it produced as in the hallowed association which it established for
                  Protestant Germany between the national religion and the educational duties of the
                  individual and the state, and doubtless this association largely contributed to
                  the creation of <pb n="965" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0965.png"/> that

                  and fixed the fee at 5 pf. (1/2 d.) a week. This was followed in 1736 by edicts
                  for the establishment of schools in certain provinces and by a royal grant of
                  50,000 thalers for that purpose in the following year. In 1763 the <foreign xml:lang="de">

                  fees, with provision for the assistance of very poor children, prescribing the
                  course of instruction, and giving directions for the examination and supervision

                  state organization of secondary education in Germany. As in England, the fear of
                  the French Revolution produced a corresponding reaction in educational affairs,

                  beyond the scope of this article. It may, however, be observed that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name>'s policy in secondary education represents a compromise between
                  the narrow philological pedantry of the old Latin schools and the large demands of
                  the new humanism of the period; and the recent reform of the Prussian secondary
                  schools may be said to represent a return to the spirit of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name> in this
                  respect. The measure introduced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name> in 1810
                  for the state examination and certification of teachers checked the then common
                  practice of permitting unqualified theological students to teach in the schools,
                  and at once raised the teaching profession to a high level of dignity and
                  efficiency which of itself sufficed to place <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> in the forefront of
                  educational progress. It was due also to the initiative of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name> that the
                  methods of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi">Pestalozzi</name>
                  were introduced into the teachers' seminaries, through them to vitalize the
                  elementary schools. To the period of the national struggle belong the revival in
                  1812 of the <foreign xml:lang="de">Abiturientenexamen</foreign> which had fallen
                  into abeyance, and the institution about the same time of the local authorities

                  reaction, the cabinet order of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_William_III_of_Prussia">Frederick
                    William III.</name> in 1825 strengthened the law of compulsory attendance and
                  carried on the work of administrative organization by defining the duties of the
                    <foreign xml:lang="de">Provinzial-Schul-Kollegium</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="de">Regierung</foreign>. In 1834 an important development was given to
                  secondary education by making it necessary for candidates for the learned
                  professions as well as for the civil service, and for university studies, to have
                  passed the leaving examination of the gymnasia. Thus through the leaving
                  examination the state holds the key to the liberal careers, and has thereby been
                  able to impose its own standard upon all secondary schools. Apart from the
                  privileges relative to professional studies, the system of leaving examinations
                  has exerted a wide influence upon popular education in connexion with the
                  institution of compulsory military service, in virtue of a regulation which
                  entitles those who pass the leaving examination of any of the recognized kinds of
                  secondary schools to the much-coveted privilege of service for one year as a <q>"

                                <p>The revolutionary and national movement of 1848 was followed by a period of
                  further educational activity. <title>The Act of Constitution</title> of 1850
                  declared teachers civil servants and elementary education free. In practice, the
                  abolition of school fees did not become general until 1888. Since then the view
                  has more and more prevailed that elementary education must be free <note>See

                  supervision of the schools; but the severity of this law as a measure against

                  subsequent reconciliation with the papacy under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Leo_III">Leo XIII.</name>, and the
                  Prussian system remains to-day both for Catholics and Protestants essentially
                  denominational. All schools, whether elementary or secondary, are Evangelical,
                  Catholic, Jewish or mixed. In the elementary sphere, in particular, recourse is
                  only had to the mixed school (<foreign xml:lang="de">

                  impracticable. In all cases the teachers are appointed with reference to religious
                  faith; religious instruction is given compulsorily in school hours and is
                  inspected by the clergy. The general purport of <title>the Prussian school law of
                    1906</title> is to strengthen the system of separate confessional schools, which
                  it extends to certain provinces where it had not previously been in operation.</p>

                  recent changes relate to the reform of secondary education referred to below. The
                  system of educational administration as it stood in 1909 may shortly be described

                  bureaucracy is somewhat checked by the rights of patronage attaching to the local
                  boards in certain cases, but the exercise of such rights is in all cases subject
                  to government approval. As regards higher-grade elementary and secondary schools,
                  the local boards in the towns <foreign xml:lang="de">

                  The <foreign xml:lang="de">Einklassige Schule</foreign> is a school taught by a
                  single teacher, who may teach a maximum number of eighty children. The <foreign xml:lang="de">Halbtagsschule</foreign> is a single-class school of which half
                  the children are taught in the morning and half in the afternoon. During the
                  summer months, owing to the exigencies of agricultural labour, many single-class
                  schools are taught as half-day schools. The system of course is regarded as a
                  makeshift, but in this, as in the matter of buildings for rural elementary
                  schools, the Prussian administration attaches great weight to the consideration of
                  financial economy. As regards staff, a large measure of economy is rendered
                  possible by the high average standard of merit reached by German elementary
                  teachers, whose powers of oral exposition have struck English observers as
                  specially remarkable, and again by the national readiness to be content with a
                  moderate salary in return for official status. A survival of the old close
                  connexion between church and school is to be found in the <foreign xml:lang="de">

                  being brought home to English educationists, that adequate value for the heavy
                  expenditure of public funds upon education can only be obtained by providing for
                  the continued education for two or three years of the children of the working
                  classes who leave school at fourteen years of age. One of the educational results
                  of the war of 1870, with its great lesson of the importance of national education,
                  was the <title>Saxon law</title> of 1873 making attendance at continuation schools
                  compulsory for three years (i.e. up to seventeen) in that kingdom. The Saxon law
                  appears to have been justified by the experience of nearly a generation. It must
                  suffice here to note the following features of its working. (1) The schools are
                  taught by the primary teachers, supplemented in the towns by some technical
                  instructors. (2) The school session may be either for the whole year or for only
                  half the year, and may also be held on Sunday, like the old English secular Sunday
                  schools. (3) The schools are brought into close relation with trades, not only for
                  purposes of curriculum, but also with a view to considering the exigencies and
                  meeting the convenience of employers with respect to hours of attendance. (4) The
                  discipline of the continuation school is extended to supervision out of school
                  hours. <quote>" Visits to dancing-halls and all such exhibitions as are dangerous
                    to uprightness and purity are forbidden to scholars of continuation
                    schools."</quote> Further, useful institutions such as savings banks, and also
                  associations for social intercourse and the promotion of <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                                        <hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi>
                                    </foreign>, are organized in connexion with continuation schools. There is no
                  doubt that in this matter of continuation schools, as in so many other fields of
                  social organization, the adoption of compulsion has been facilitated by the
                  habituation of the working classes to compulsory military service, which has made
                  the German workman more disciplined, more <q>" organizable "</q> as a social unit,
                  more accustomed to subordinate the principle of individual freedom and self-will
                  to the collective claims of the state, than the workman reared in the traditions
                  of Anglo-Saxon individualism.</p>
                                <p>Attendance at continuation schools is now compulsory by state law in 12 states,
                  including (besides <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saxony">Saxony</name>) <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baden">Baden</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Württemberg">Württemberg</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bavaria">Bavaria</name>.

                  German secondary education is the careful differentiation of schools according to
                  the type of curriculum adopted. Thus, every German school is a homogeneous unit
                  with a definite educational aim and organization, conforming to a common standard
                  approved by public authority for the particular type to which it belongs. Hence
                  the importance attached by the Germans to nomenclature; so that in selecting a
                    <foreign xml:lang="de">Gymnasium</foreign>, a <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign> or an <foreign xml:lang="de">Oberrealschule</foreign>,
                  the parent knows exactly the type of education he is going to secure for his son.
                  In England, on the other hand, as has often been observed, a great school tends to
                  multiply within itself different types of curricula in a haphazard way according
                  to the demand of parents, whose original choice of school is based rather on
                  social than on educational grounds. Modern sides, army classes and engineering
                  classes grow up as excrescences upon an originally classical type, with the waste
                  of power that results from loss of consistency and concentration of purpose. The
                  difference between the English and German systems is due ultimately to the
                  adoption in Germany of the day-school system and the absence, very remarkable in
                  an otherwise aristocratically governed country, of the caste spirit in education
                  above the elementary level, thanks to which the nobly born are not ashamed to sit
                  on the school bench side by side with the children of the trading classes. On the
                  other hand, the English boarding-school system, despite all the want of social
                  solidarity, and all the class jealousy and exclusiveness with which it is
                  inevitably associated, has admittedly favoured those ideals of the cultivation of
                  character as distinct from book-learning which give a special value to what is in
                  England called a public school education.</p>

                                <p>The present differentiation of first-grade schools in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> is the result of a
                  natural educational development corresponding with the economic changes which have
                  transformed <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> and the empire from an agricultural to an industrial state. It
                  was in 1855 that semi-classical schools (teaching Latin without Greek) were first
                  recognized for a nine years' course under the title of <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule I. Ordnung</foreign>, and in 1871 pupils possessing their leaving
                  certificates were admitted to mathematical studies in the universities. The
                  Latinless <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule II. Ordnung</foreign> is the direct
                  product of the great industrial development of the modern empire. In 1882 the
                    <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule I. Ordnung</foreign> received the title of
                    <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule II. Ordnung</foreign> that of <foreign xml:lang="de">Oberrealschule</foreign>, both types being at the same time admitted to certain

                    Alexey Gorobiy</note>. These two types differ from each other in detail, but the
                  feature which distinguishes both from the older types is the postponement of Latin
                  to Untertertia. The design is to secure for all types of secondary education a
                  common non-classical base coextensive with the first three years of school life,
                  followed by a bifurcation or threefold choice between the classical, semiclassical
                  and non-classical types. The principle of the <q>" reform-school "</q> has been
                  adopted in a considerable number of German (chiefly Prussian) schools, but it
                  would be premature to see in it at present more than a new variety of <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign> or semiclassical school ; it can hardly be
                  said as yet to have affected the course of classical studies in the full sense.
                  The widespread sentiment of discontent with the old philological type of classical
                  school was vigorously expressed in a private letter written by the emperor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor">William II.</name> as crown prince of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> in 1885, but not
                  published until some years later. In December 1890 the Prussian ministry convoked
                  a conference at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> of secondary school experts, and the emperor presided in person
                  at the opening session. His Majesty delivered a speech criticizing the Gymnasia as
                  wanting a national basis. <quote>" It is our duty to educate young men to become
                    young Germans and not young Greeks or Romans"</quote> was the keynote of the
                  imperial discourse. The outcome of the conference was a shortening of the hours
                  allowed to Latin in the Gymnasia, a reduction of the hours of study in view of
                  over-pressure, and an expression of official opinion adverse to the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign>. These changes, introduced in 1892, did
                  not go far enough to satisfy the reformers, whilst the reduction of the hours
                  allowed for Latin caused misgivings among the upholders of the traditional
                  Gymnasium. Moreover, the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign> showed
                  greater vitality among the large towns than its official critics anticipated. The
                  ensuing decade witnessed a certain reaction in favour of the classical humanities
                  as a barrier against the materialistic influences of the new industrialism. At the
                  same time the protagonists of the classics came to recognize that side by side
                  with the old humanities there must be accorded to modern and scientific subjects
                  that place in the high-grade schools which the practical exigencies of industrial
                  life demanded. Thus, the opinion grew that the best line of defence for the
                  classical schools lay in the concession of equal privileges to the non-classical
                  types ; in this way only could the classical schools be kept safe from demands
                  upon their time that could not be conceded without endangering their proper work.
                  It was upon this basis that an agreement was reached between the contending
                  parties at a second school conference that met in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> in June 1900. As the
                  result of this conference there was issued a royal decree laying down certain
                  general principles, of which the following are the most important. <list>
                                        <item>(1) There must be equality of privileges as between classical,
                      semiclassical and non-classical first-grade schools. The decree recognizes,
                      however, that this principle must be applied with a certain elasticity and
                      with due regard to the necessity for training in particular branches of
                      knowledge as a preliminary to certain lines of university study and certain
                      professional pursuits. Consequently the Prussian system of privileges has
                      become extremely complicated, and it is truer to speak, as the decree goes on
                      to do, of an extension of the privileges of the nonclassical schools, rather
                      than of absolute equality.</item>
                                        <item>(2) <quote>" In thus acknowledging the equality of the three types of
                        higher institutions, it will be possible more thoroughly to strengthen the
                        special characteristics of each type. In this connexion," the royal decree
                        proceeds, " I shall offer no objection to an increase in the number of hours
                        devoted to Latin in the Gymnasium and <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign>."</quote> Thus, both as to the place of Latin in
                      the curriculum of classical schools and as to the status of semi-classical
                      schools, the decree of 1900 involves a reversal of the policy of 1890.</item>
                                        <item>(3) The decree expresses approval of the reformed curricula of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Altona,_Hamburg">Altona</name>

                  Germany continue to show a marked preference for the fully classical Gymnasium;
                  hence, in Germany as in England, the tendency for a widening gulf to disclose
                  itself between the education of the directing classes in politics and
                  administration and the bulk of the industrial population, which suggests that the
                  problem of combining in just proportions the liberal and practical elements in a
                  thoroughly national system of education has not yet reached the solution that the

                  broad principles by the constitution, to the indirect influence exerted by the

                                <p>The cantonal organization of education presents the variety which the
                  extraordinary diversity of race, language, religion and physical conditions of the
                  component states of the federation would lead one to expect. The large <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canton_of_Berne">canton of
                    Bern</name> may be instanced as the type of a strong central authority. The
                  commune or parish is the unit for elementary education. The communal council
                  nominates a school board of at least five members, whose function is to spend the
                  money voted for school purposes by the general communal council. Several communes
                  in combination form a district authority for the support of what are in reality
                  higher primary schools, though called in Switzerland <foreign xml:lang="de">
                                        <hi rend="italic">Sekundarschulen</hi>
                                    </foreign>, maintained by the district. The maintenance both of the primary and
                  higher primary schools is aided by grants from the central authority. The true
                  secondary schools, called middle or higher schools, are maintained and controlled
                  by the central or cantonal authority. The existence of separate local authorities
                  for each grade of education is characteristic of Switzerland generally, this
                  system being the opposite to that adopted in England in 1902.</p>
                                <p>The central grants in Switzerland always take the form of payments to the local
                  authorities of a proportion of the teachers' salaries ; they are never, as in
                  England, assessed upon the number of children in attendance, nor are they
                  dependent, as was formerly the case in England, upon the results of examination,
                  nor again are grants made in respect of particular subjects as is the case with
                  the grants for special, i.e. practical, instruction in England.</p>
                                <p>Religious instruction in the Swiss communal schools generally follows the faith
                  of the majority; in a few cantons separate schools being provided for minorities
                  if sufficiently numerous. In the town of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucerne">Lucerne</name>, Catholic instruction
                  is given in school hours, and Protestant instruction is provided out of school and
                  out of hours for the Protestant minority.</p>
                                <p>In 19 out of the 25 cantons attendance at continuation schools is compulsory (at
                  least in some districts) for boys up to 17, and in 3 cantons it is compulsory also
                  wholly or in part for girls.</p>

                                    <item>I. The law of 1842 obliged the communes to provide primary instruction,
                    which was to be free in the case of poor children. The state made grants in aid,
                    subject to inspection. Subject to a conscience clause, religious instruction was
                    obligatory, and was placed under ecclesiastical inspection.</item>
                                    <item>2. The law of 1879 removed religious instruction from the curriculum, and
                    provided for facilities to the clergy to give such instruction outside school
                    hours. This law furnishes a striking instance of the futility of a parliamentary
                    majority legislating in a sense opposed to the convictions of a considerable
                    section of the community. The law evoked a storm of opposition in the country,
                    still profoundly Catholic and attached to ecclesiastical traditions, and within
                    eighteen months the Catholics founded private elementary schools with 455,000
                    scholars. In 1883 the Catholic private schools numbered 622,000 scholars, whilst
                    the attendance at the communal schools had sunk to 324,000. Their doctrinaire
                    treatment of the education question resulted in the political annihilation of
                    the Belgian Liberals, and was responsible for the strongest and most persistent
                    Roman Catholic reaction that has been witnessed in western Europe since the
                    beginning of the 19th century.</item>
                                    <item>3. The law of 1884 was the work of the moderate Catholic party. It did not
                    make religious instruction obligatory, but it gave liberty to the communes to
                    provide for the giving of religious and moral instruction at the beginning or
                    end of school hours, subject to a conscience clause. Power was given to the
                    communes to <q>" adopt "</q> private confessional schools and maintain them.
                    Provision was further made entitling any twenty parents of children of school
                    age to demand a school of the normal communal type, as against a proposal to
                    adopt a confessional school. Power was also given to a like number of parents to
                    compel the adoption of a confessional school in the case of the commune refusing
                    to provide religious instruction of the type demanded by them, or putting
                    obstacles in the way of its being given by the clergy or their
                    representatives.</item>
                                    <item>4. The law of 1895 is the work of the more authoritarian Catholics, and
                    makes religious instruction obligatory, placing it directly under the control of
                    the clergy. It also increased the subsidies to private schools. This law was
                    passed in face of opposition from the moderate section, who saw in it an
                    exaltation of state authority which might be turned by opponents to the
                    disadvantage of the religious interest.- It is by no means clear that Belgium
                    has yet attained a final solution of the religious difficulty ; the life of the
                    present law is probably to be measured by that of the Catholic political
                    majority.</item>

                                <p>The outstanding feature of public education in Holland is the strength of the
                  private primary schools. Under the law of 1857 secular teaching alone was provided
                  in the primary schools at the public cost. The law of 1878 allowed communes to
                  make grants to private schools on condition of their becoming neutral in the
                  matter of religion. The law of 1889 allowed private denominational schools to
                  receive government grants while retaining their denominational character, but
                  forbade further grants to such schools by the communes.</p>
                                <p>In 1905 there were 566,460 children in the public and 278,632 in the private
                  schools.</p>

                                <p>The diverse religious and social conditions of the three constituent parts of the
                  United Kingdom must necessarily cause the education problem to assume a different
                  shape and to receive different solutions in England, Scotland and Ireland
                  respectively; latterly also the special conditions obtaining in Wales have
                  received partial recognition at the hands both of the legislature and the
                  executive. In Scotland the conditions have been less complex than in England. The
                  practical unanimity of the people in religious faith, which has remained
                  undisturbed by the institutional divisions of recent times, the wider diffusion of
                  a sense of the value of education, the greater simplicity of life which has
                  rendered all classes largely content to avail themselves of the preparatory
                  education afforded by the common school and favoured the development in the
                  secondary sphere of day rather than boarding schools, are among the causes which
                  have contributed to the early building up of a national system which in some
                  respects resembles the continental rather than the English type.</p>

                                <p>The national appreciation of education is found marked already before the
                  Reformation in a statute of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_IV_of_Scotland">James IV.</name> (1494)
                  requiring all freeholders of substance to send their heirs to school and to keep
                  them there until they had perfect Latin. The Reformation, asserting itself by
                  common consent under one ecclesiastical form, and free from the divisions of
                  religious organization which tended to neutralize it as an educational force in
                  England, put fresh life into the educational aspirations of the people. As early

                                    </ref> Practical effect was later given to this scheme by an act of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament">the
                    Scottish parliament</name> in 1696, under which parish schools were set up in

                    Scotland</name>. This system was extended by an act of 1803, which made better
                  provision for teachers' salaries and also confirmed the position of the parish
                  school as an adjunct of the parish church. The system of inspection and state aid
                  introduced in England in 1839 was made applicable to Scotland, thus grafting upon
                  Scotland the English system of voluntary state-aided schools. At the same period
                  another new factor was imported into Scottish education by the ecclesiastical
                  disruption of 1843. As a result of these changes in 1861 a new act was passed
                  which relaxed, though it did not sever, the ties which bound the parish school to
                  the church.</p>

                                <p>The Education (Scotland) Act of 1872 set up elective school boards for parishes
                  and boroughs, and vested in them the existing parish and burgh schools. Long prior
                  to the act it had been the practice of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_Scotland">the Church of
                    Scotland</name> to allow exemption in the schools from religious instruction ;
                  consequently in imposing a compulsory conscience clause the act did little more
                  than confirm existing usage. The school boards were left full liberty as to the
                  religious instruction to be given in their schools, and in practice school boards
                  universally adopt <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Shorter_Catechism">Westminster
                    Shorter Catechism</title>, which is acceptable to all denominations of
                  Presbyterians. The act made the school boards responsible for the supply of school
                  accommodation, and introduced compulsory attendance, for which opinion in England
                  was not at that time ripe. By the act of 1901, the age of compulsory attendance
                  was raised to fourteen, with provision for exemption after twelve.</p>

                  of individual examination as the basis for the payment of grants. The institution
                  of the merit certificate is one of the features in which the Scottish system
                  differs from the English. Prior to the code of 1903 the merit certificate, awarded
                  on examination after the age of twelve, was properly described as the leaving
                  certificate of the elementary school. Under the more recent codes merit
                  certificates are awarded under a system designed to encourage the transference of
                  promising pupils at an early age to supplementary courses or higher-grade
                  departments. Under this system the fitness of the pupil to enter upon a course of
                  higher studies is determined not solely by the results of a single examination,
                  but by the whole character of his work during the preceding school course.</p>

                                        <title>The Scottish Education Act of 1872</title> distinguished certain burgh

                                    </ref> or secondary schools. The act of 1908 deals in some detail with secondary
                  education, modifying and strengthening the framework in various ways, but without
                  introducing organic changes, <q>" Secondary "</q> schools are distinguished from
                    <q>"intermediate,"</q> the former being defined as providing at least a five
                  years' course ; the latter as providing at least a three years' course in
                  languages, mathematics, science and such other subjects as may from time to time
                  be deemed suitable for the instruction of pupils who have reached a certain
                  standard of attainment in elementary subjects under the code. Intermediate and
                  secondary schools may be provided and maintained either by school boards or
                  otherwise, and provision is contained in the act for the transfer of endowed
                  schools to the school board. Thus secondary (as well as elementary and
                  continuative) education is organized upon the basis of the parish or burgh ; it
                  receives, however, grants in aid through the agency of county (or large urban)
                  authorities (called district committees) constituted under schemes of <name type="institution">the Scottish Education Department</name>. For the purpose of
                  such grants in aid the funds available under the various local taxation acts,
                  together with parliamentary grants, other than a fee grant at the rate of 12s. per
                  child in average attendance, form a fund called the Education (Scotland) Fund.
                  After provision has been made for <foreign xml:lang="la">

                  colleges, the fund is allocated to the district committees according to a scheme
                  laid before parliament and approved by the king in council. Out of the <q>"
                    district education fund"</q> the school board receives (ordinarily) a sum equal
                  to one-half of the amount by which the net cost to the school board (after
                  deducting income from grants made by the department and from fees) exceeds the
                  amount which would be produced by such rate per pound upon the district of the
                  school board as the committee may determine, not being more than a rate of
                  twopence in the pound. Important powers are also conferred upon the district
                  committee for organizing and aiding within their district the provision by the
                  school boards of medical examination and supervision of school children, the

                                <p>The full development of a system of public education in Ireland has been hampered
                  and retarded by the general difficulties inherent in the problem of Irish
                  government. In consequence of the fundamentally different social, religious and
                  political conditions in the two countries, the English and Irish systems have
                  developed down to the present time upon divergent lines. In England, popular
                  education was founded in the first instance upon individual initiative combining
                  in organized voluntary effort, and, though the voluntary agencies have been first
                  supplemented and latterly to a large extent supplanted by public action, the
                  tendency has been in the direction of municipalization rather than in that of
                  central state control. In Ireland, on the other hand, education has suffered in
                  the past from the general absence of individual initiative and local interest
                  almost as seriously as from the mistakes of the English government. These causes,
                  more directly perhaps than the prevailing poverty of the country, made it
                  necessary to throw the burden of supporting the schools to an increasing extent
                  upon the state, while the want of local self-government precluded any devolution
                  of powers and duties upon municipal authorities.</p>

                                <p>State intervention is actually of earlier date in Ireland than in England. From
                  the reign of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth</name>
                  onwards, English Protestant schools were founded by the government in a sporadic
                  and intermittent fashion in pursuance of its Anglicizing policy. To mention
                  briefly one or two historical features, the great religious educational enterprise
                  of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmund_Ignatius_Rice">Edmond Rice</name> in founding the well-known <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers">Irish
                    Catholic order of the Christian Brothers</name> in 1802 forms an exception to
                  the general lack of initiative among the people themselves. About the same period
                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kildare_Place_National_School">the Kildare
                    Place Society</name> (founded in 1811 while the first commission of inquiry into
                  Irish education was sitting) attempted to grapple with the peculiar difficulties
                  of the religious situation upon lines somewhat similar to those just laid down by
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> and his followers in England. This organization comprised both
                  Roman Catholic and Protestant schools upon a common religious basis of
                    <title>Bible</title> reading without note or comment, and received government
                  grants which rose to £30,000 a year before they were discontinued in 1833. The
                  religious compromise which the system embodied broke down in consequence of
                  Catholic dissatisfaction, and that it was at first fairly successful may seem
                  extraordinary in view of the later attitude of the Catholic Church towards the
                  question of common schools and combined religious instruction.</p>

                                <p>In 1833, as the result of a second commission of inquiry (1824) and a select

                  (1828), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Smith-Stanley,_14th_Earl_of_Derby">Mr
                    Stanley</name> inaugurated the national system of elementary schools under a
                  board of commissioners nominated from the different religious denominations. The
                  government appears from the outset to have aimed at combined secular and separate
                  religious instruction for Roman Catholics and Protestants. At the same time, an
                  attempt was inconsistently made to provide an ethical basis for the secular
                  instruction by means of <title>Bible</title> extracts. The story of the
                  preparation of these extracts by an ingenious compound of the Protestant
                  Authorized and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douay-Rheims_Bible">Douai</title> versions of Scripture is in its way one of the curiosities of
                  religious history. The extracts were designed to meet the recognized Catholic
                  objection to the indiscriminate reading of <title>the Bible</title> without note
                  or comment. In practice they were chiefly used in the Protestant schools (in which
                  their use is now practically extinct), and the growing Catholic objection to the
                  policy of <name type="institution">the National Board</name> in this respect found
                  authoritative, though somewhat cautiously worded, expression in a decree of the
                  Roman Congregation <ref>
                                        <title>De Propaganda Fide</title> of January 11, 1846, declaring that
                    non-sectarian religious instruction was dangerous to youth. <quote>

                                    </ref> The religious difficulty in Irish elementary education may be said to have
                  been solved in process of time by the conversion of the national system in
                  practice, though not in theory, into a system strongly denominational and
                  therefore widely different from the design of its founders, combined Biblical
                  instruction being discarded, and separate schools for the most part taking the
                  place of common schools for the two creeds. In the latter respect the like
                  tendency has been noted in the case of Germany.</p>
                                <p>The following are the chief specific points upon which the Irish system of
                  elementary education differs from the English.</p>

                  extent of two-thirds of the cost. Such grants are only made to what are called
                  vested schools, that is to say, schools of which the premises are vested in
                  trustees or in the commissioners themselves. The state further pays in the case of
                  all national schools the entire cost of maintenance except only the upkeep of the
                  building, and the provision of books after the exhaustion of a first free

                  promotion the state through its inspectors undertakes the duty of classifying the
                  individual teachers in four grades, passage from one grade to another being
                  secured by examination. Appointments of teachers to schools are made by the school
                  managers subject to the approval of the commissioners. Rights of dismissal are
                  reserved to the local managers and also to the commissioners independently.
                  Lastly, the teachers' salaries are now paid directly by the state. The old system
                  of payment by results was abandoned in 1900, and the teacher is paid <list>

                  schools which receive capitation grants after the English plan, but not direct
                  salaries. There were 308 such schools in 1908, with an average attendance of
                  70,003. There were also 83 other convent or monastery schools paid by personal
                  salaries, with an average attendance of 11,075.</p>

                  As regards religious denomination, 74-42 % of the scholars on the rolls were Roman
                  Catholics; 28-6 % were in schools attended by both Roman Catholic and Protestant
                  children and 71-4 % in schools attended solely by Roman Catholics or solely by
                  Protestants. The total expenditure on the schools and teaching staffs was

                                <p>One of the chief desiderata in Irish education is a single central authority for
                  all branches of education, elementary, secondary (or <q>" intermediate "</q>) and
                  technical. There are two <pb n="971" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0971.png"/> central authorities dealing with secondary education, viz. <name type="institution">the Intermediate Education Board</name> and <name type="institution">the Department for Agriculture and Technical
                    Instruction</name>. The Intermediate Board administers sums available under
                    <title>the Intermediate Education Act of 1878</title> from the Irish Church
                  Surplus, and also the sum allocated under <title>the Local Taxation Act
                    1890</title>. The vice of the system in the opinion of educational experts lies
                  in the statutory obligation to award grants on the result of an individual
                  examination of the scholars. As a result of the vice-regal commission of 1898,
                  power was taken to introduce a system of school inspection, though not to dispense
                  with the individual examination as the basis for the award of the grants; this
                  measure of reform was ultimately carried out in 1909. The sum distributed in
                  result grants is about £50,000 per annum.</p>
                                <p>Prior to <title>the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act
                    1899</title>, science and art grants were administered by <name type="institution">the Science and Art Department</name> in England ; by this
                  act they were transferred to the new <name type="institution">Irish Department for
                    Agriculture and Technical Instruction</name>. This department makes block grants
                  to secondary schools in respect of science and art teaching, and manual
                  instruction or domestic economy. Measures have been taken for the co-ordination of
                  the duties of <name type="institution">the Technical Department</name> and <name type="institution">the Intermediate Board</name>, and the impetus given to the
                  teaching of experimental science by grants for the erection of laboratories
                  represents a reform of undoubted value for higher education in Ireland, especially
                  when considered in connexion with the enlistment of the local interest of the
                  technical education committees in the intermediate schools. Nevertheless, in the
                  absence of a reform of the results system of intermediate grants, the special
                  subsidizing of science teaching has tended to put an undue premium upon this
                  subject to the detriment of the rest of the curriculum.</p>
                                <p>Ireland possesses no such system of scholarships for assisting the passage of
                  scholars from the elementary to the secondary school as England enjoys as a result
                  of the municipalization of the educational system. Nevertheless, Irish children as
                  a fact pass much more freely from the elementary to the secondary school than is
                  the case in England where social prejudices are stronger. The schools of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers">the
                    Christian Brothers</name> are usually organized in two departments, primary and
                  intermediate, and thus supply for the Roman Catholic population the demand for the
                  cheap type of secondary day school represented by the municipal schools in
                  England. It must be added that the Irish intermediate schools are purely
                  denominational. The widespread demand for secondary education among the people, to
                  which the report of Messrs <name type="person">Dale</name> and <name type="person">Stephens</name> bears witness, is a gratifying feature of Irish life, while the
                  recent establishment (1908) of the long-deferred national university, and the
                  perceptible quickening of intellectual interests throughout the country in
                  connexion with the Celtic revival, point to better conditions for higher education
                  and to the development of a wider, deeper and truer, because more national,
                  culture.</p>

                      public provision for the education of the people in England is not the product
                      of any theory or plan formulated beforehand by statesmen or philosophers; it
                      has come into existence through a long course of experiments, compromises,
                      traditions, successes, failures and religious controversies. What has been
                      done in this department of public policy is the resultant of many diverse
                      forces and of slow evolution and growth rather than of pure purpose and
                      well-defined national aims. It has been effected in different degrees by
                      philanthropy, by private enterprise, by religious zeal, by ancient
                      universities and endowed foundations, by municipal and local effort, and only
                      to a small extent by legislation. The genius—or rather characteristic habit—of
                      the English people is averse from the philosophical system, and is disposed to
                      regard education, not as a science, but as a body of expedients to be
                      discovered empirically and amended from time to time as occasion may
                      require."</quote>
                                    </ref> Clearly, then, the English system of public education, as it results from
                  successive acts of the administration and the legislature, is one which can only
                  adequately be appreciated in the light of an historical survey of the various
                  stages which have led up to it and the social conditions by which they were
                  determined. The history of state education in England begins tardily in 1832, when
                  after a generation of hesitation and controversy a beginning was made upon an
                  exceedingly modest scale with the system of treasury grants in aid of elementary
                  schools. The diverse forces which were at that date at work in the education of
                  the nation as a whole, retarding state interference and marking out the limits
                  within which it was long to be confined, derive their origin from a much remoter
                  period.</p>

                                <p>The apprenticeship laws of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII.</name>
                  contain the earliest germ of state interference. These laws obliged children
                  between five and thirteen years of age who were found begging or idle to be bound
                  apprentices to some handicraft. If the immediate object was the prevention of
                  crime rather than education as such, this early legislation is at least
                  significant of the primary and intimate connexion that exists between popular
                  education and industrial and economic needs. Yet in the shaping of the educational
                  system the original influences were religious rather than economic ; hence the
                  importance of the canons of 1604, which secured the control of education to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the
                    Established Church</name>. This of course was no novel doctrine, but merely the
                  reaffirmation by the Reformed Church of the Catholic tradition of religious
                  exclusiveness, presenting itself to the mind of contemporaries rather as the
                  recognition of a national, that was also a religious, duty than as the assumption
                  of an ecclesiastical privilege. Whatever mischief the Tudor statesmen wrought by
                  indiscriminate destruction of chantries and other foundations which combined
                  educational work with observances that the new religion branded as superstitious,
                  however far the English Reformation fell short of the organized enthusiasm for
                  popular education and culture that marked the first most vigorous and constructive
                  period of Lutheranism in Germany, the Protestant, and especially the Puritan,
                  spirit unquestionably inspired a considerable volume of individual educational
                  effort during the latter half of the 16th and the first half of the 17th
                  centuries. Here, as in Germany, the influence of the Reformation was wholly on the
                  side of classicism, the dead languages being the key to the theological learning
                  which was of primary concern to the men of that theological age. The conception of
                  elementary education as a system complete in itself and adapted to the needs of
                  the masses of the people was unfamiliar at this date. The earliest elementary
                  schools were <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                                        <hi rend="italic">petits</hi>
                                    </foreign> schools, which (as the name implies) were really preparatory
                  departments of the grammar-schools. Education in fact was still regarded as the
                  privilege of an elite, but, as in the middle ages, the elite for whom it was
                  sought to provide a ladder to the university by means of the endowed schools so
                  numerously founded about this time was an elite of intellect and not of mere
                  wealth; the class feeling which became so marked a feature of English higher
                  education was of much later growth.</p>

                                <p>Towards the end of the 17th century elementary education began to differentiate
                  itself, partly by way of reaction against the unnatural classicism of the
                  preceding age, but more especially as the result of the growth of towns and the
                  creation of a considerable industrial population. At the close of the century the
                  moral evils attendant upon industrialism alarmed the religious conscience and
                  prompted one of the great educational movements that stand to the credit of the
                  national church. In 1699 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Bray">Dr Bray</name> founded <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Society_for_Promoting_Christian_Knowledge">the
                    Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge</name>, and the movement
                  thereby initiated may be traced in the numerous <q>" charity "</q> or <q>" Blue
                    Coat"</q> schools scattered plentifully throughout the country and especially in
                  the great centres of population. The foundation of these schools, which was pushed
                  forward with vigour during the early years of the 18th century, represents an
                  energetic and wellplanned attempt to cope with the social evil of poverty by
                  educational means. The instruction was elementary, the scholars were clothed as
                  well as taught free, and the schools in the first instance were supported not so
                  much by permanent endowment <pb n="972" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0972.png"/> as by voluntary effort, so that
                  with this movement the voluntary system may be said to make its appearance.
                  Lastly, all these philanthropic efforts were inspired by a solid but sober piety
                  nurtured by a church which came nearer than at any other period of its history to
                  enjoying the undivided allegiance of the people. Another notable movement in
                  connexion with the church was one confined to Wales, that of the Welsh <q>"
                    circulating schools "</q> established by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Griffith_Jones_(Llanddowror)">Griffith
                    Jones</name> about 1730, consisting of an organized staff of schoolmasters who
                  went round teaching adults to read <title>the Bible</title> in Welsh. In the
                  English rural parishes the comparative religious unanimity favoured the quiet
                  development of elementary education in a small way upon less specifically
                  religious lines. Numerous small endowments for the elementary education of poor
                  children were provided by well-to-do parishioners ; indeed to such an extent did
                  the practice of making charitable (and largely educational) bequests increase that
                  the legislature intervened in the interest of private inheritance by reviving the
                  law of mortmain in an act of 1736. The village schoolmaster became a feature of
                  rural life, frequently enjoying a schoolhouse provided sometimes by endowment and
                  sometimes even directly by the parishioners at the cost of the rate levied by the
                  vestry, but more often aided only by a little stipend from an endowment for
                  teaching poor children, and eking out an always scanty subsistence by the fees of
                  such paying scholars as he could succeed in getting together.</p>

                  virtue of his achievement in organization, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Raikes">Raikes</name> is rightly
                  regarded as the founder of the English Sunday school. The peculiar value of the
                  Sunday-school system in its early days lay in the combination of secular with
                  religious instruction ; in many cases the school was held on Saturday as well as
                  Sunday, and its restriction to the one day or two days was due to the prevalence
                  of child labour under stress of the great industrial expansion. With better
                  economic conditions and with the development of day schools the Sunday schools
                  gradually became restricted in function to purely religious instruction. Even with
                  this limitation there is no doubt that the great Sunday-school organizations of
                  the various churches still deserve to be reckoned among the educational assets of
                  the nation, and as agencies both of religious instruction and of general culture
                  they may tend, under modern educational and religious developments, to play an
                  increasingly important part.</p>

                                <p>At the end of the 18th century the development of industry and the social unrest
                  which followed the French Revolution combined to bring home to the public mind the
                  need of a national system of day schools. Unfortunately, just at this moment the
                  revival of Nonconformity as the result of the religious vitality of the
                  Evangelical movement shattered the religious peace of the early Hanoverian period
                  and divided the nation once more into hostile camps, to which class distinctions
                  lent additional bitterness. The famous controversy between <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Bell_(educationalist)">Andrew
                    Bell</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Joseph Lancaster</name> and
                  their respective followers in the opening years of the 19th centuiy served to
                  define the religious difficulty substantially in the form in which it exists after
                  the lapse of a century for the present generation. Both these remarkable men
                  conceived independently the idea of a national system of popular education upon a
                  voluntary basis; both concurred in extolling the merits of the monitorial system,
                  which each claimed to have originated. The controversy between them, begun upon
                  personal grounds, resolved itself into a national contest of rival principles of
                  religious teaching. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> as a young
                  Quaker schoolmaster, confronted with pupils drawn from various religious bodies,
                  planned his religious instruction upon the lines of doctrine common to all the
                  orthodox Christian denominations. Thus he is the father of the undenominational
                  religious teaching which later formed the basis of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name> compromise. But whereas <title>the Cowper-Temple
                    clause</title> is purely negative in form and so seems to point to an undogmatic
                  religion, the Lancasterian teaching was essentially positive and dogmatic within
                  its limits. In 1805 <bibl>

                                    </bibl>. The church as a whole refused to co-operate in religious teaching upon
                  the basis of a common Christianity, and joined issue with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> and his Whig
                  and Nonconformist following not merely upon the question of the exclusion of
                  dogmatic formularies, but also upon the question of the control of whatever
                  religious teaching should be given. In fact the vital question at this period was
                  whether the clergy of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Established
                    Church</name> were to control the national education. The religious issue was
                  prominent in connexion with the remarkable attempt at legislation made by the Whig
                  statesman <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Whitbread">Mr Whitbread</name> in his <title>Parochial Schools Bill</title> of 1807. As
                  originally introduced, the bill proposed to make it compulsory on parochial
                  vestries to levy rates for the support of schools for teaching reading, writing
                  and arithmetic. The compulsory provisions were dropped in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name>,
                  but the bill was rejected by <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords">the Lords</name>, mainly on the
                  ground that it did not place education on a religious basis or sufficiently secure
                  control to the minister of the parish.</p>

                  schools in connexion with the church, of which 6470 were both day and Sunday
                  schools, having a total attendance of 409,000.</p>

                                <p>The rapid development of the voluntary school system was no doubt greatly
                  facilitated by the monitorial plan of teaching, upon which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Bell_(educationalist)">Bell</name> and
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> equally relied. Probably the first idea of utilizing the older
                  pupils to teach the younger presented itself independently to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Borough_Road">the Borough

                  monitorial plan never rested upon any educational theory; it was simply a
                  makeshift, a rough-and-ready expedient for overcoming the practical difficulty
                  caused by the dearth of competent teachers. Historically it is important as the
                  precursor of the pupil-teacher system which so long formed the exclusive basis of
                  the English elementary system.</p>

                  activities. In 1816 he procured the appointment of a general commission of inquiry
                  into endowed charities. The labours of this great inquisition lasted for twenty
                  years and led <pb n="973" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0973.png"/> to the
                  reformation of many cases of abuse or waste of wealthy endowments, and eventually
                  to the establishment of <name type="institution">the Charity Commission</name> in
                  1853. In 1820 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Brougham,_1st_Baron_Brougham_and_Vaux">Brougham</name> introduced a remarkable bill which proposed to make the

                  and to be appointed upon a certificate from the parochial clergyman, and on the
                  other hand to prohibit religious formularies and to confine religious instruction
                  to Bible reading without comment. The bill naturally failed through the opposition
                  of the Dissenters, and served only to accentuate the religious impasse.</p>

                                <p>In 1832 the Whig government which passed the Reform Bill placed on the Estimates
                  a sum of £20,000 for public education, thus initiating the system of the annual
                  grant voted by parliament and dispensed under regulations framed by administrative
                  act. The grant of 1832 was administered by <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/HM_Treasury">the treasury</name> and not by a
                  special department, under certain conditions laid down by <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/HM_Treasury">treasury</name> minute of August
                  30, 1833. The chief of these were that grants were confined to the erection of
                  school buildings, and were to be administered only through the National and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_and_Foreign_School_Society">the British

                    Melbourne</name>'s government by means of an order in council established a
                  separate education office under the style of <name type="institution">the
                    Committee of Council on Education</name>, and the sum voted by parliament was
                  increased to £39,000. The original intention of the government was to establish a
                  state normal school or training college as the foundation of a national system of
                  education. Unfortunately this design had to be abandoned in view of the religious
                  difficulty, with the result (so fruitful in controversy at the present time) that
                  the training of elementary teachers was left in private hands and became a
                  stronghold of the voluntary and denominational interests. In view of the limited
                  resources placed at their disposal by parliament, <name type="institution">the
                    Committee of Council</name> were at first compelled to confine their assistance
                  to capital grants in aid of the provision of school buildings, but in the
                  distribution of the money three important conditions were at once imposed. In the
                  first place, the continuing right of inspection was required in all cases ;
                  secondly, promoters were obliged to conform to a fixed standard of structural
                  efficiency; thirdly, the building must be settled upon trusts permanently securing
                  it to the education of poor children.</p>

                  Under this minute no appointment was to be made of any person to inspect schools
                  in connexion with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Church of England</name>
                  without the concurrence of the archbishop of the province, and, what seems still
                  more extraordinary to modern ideas, any such appointment was to be revoked should
                  the archbishop at any time withdraw his concurrence. The inspectors were charged
                  with the duty of inspecting religious teaching, but under instructions to be
                  framed by the archbishop, and their reports were to be transmitted in duplicate to
                  the archbishop and the bishop for the information of these authorities. Further,
                  the general instructions of <name type="institution">the Committee of
                    Council</name> themselves were to be communicated to the archbishop before being
                  finally sanctioned. The march of events, and in particular the altered financial
                  relations between the state and the voluntary managers brought about by the
                  institution of maintenance grants, soon rendered this concordat obsolete, but it
                  remains historically important as showing how at the outset the denominational

                  was the promulgation of a set of model trust deeds, one or other of which
                  applicants for building grants were required to adopt for the settlement of their
                  school premises. The necessary conditions were the permanent appropriation of the
                  site to purposes of education, and the permanent right of government inspection;
                  it must, however, be noted that this latter right was generally limited in terms
                  to the inspection provided for by the minute of August 10, 1840. A conscience
                  clause was not obligatory, and indeed was only offered in the limited form of
                  exemption from instruction in formularies and attendance at Sunday school or
                  public worship. A more systematic attempt to promote public control by means of
                  trust deeds in 1846 led <name type="institution">the Committee of Council</name>
                  into a controversy with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Society_for_Promoting_Religious_Education">the National Society</name> which extended over a period of three years,
                  turning chiefly upon the management clauses and the question of appeals, and
                  resulting in compromises which constituted a fresh concordat with the church. In
                  point of fact, the management clauses proved to be of little practical
                  consequence, save in a few controversial cases, until <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>,

                  also dealt specifically with two other points arising upon the old trust deeds,
                  viz. the control of religious instruction and the appeal to the bishop in
                  religious questions. Special facilities for the conveyance of land for school
                  purposes were afforded to limited owners by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School_Sites_Act_1841">the School Sites Acts of
                    1841</title> and subsequent years. The landed gentry responded with great public
                  spirit to the call thus made upon their generosity by the state, with the result
                  that the vast majority of rural, and many urban, parishes were freely endowed with
                  sites for elementary schools.</p>

                  case of the decayed <q>" grammar "</q> (i.e. classical) schools which abounded
                  throughout the country, belongs to the history of elementary rather than secondary
                  education. It expressly empowered <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_Chancery">the Court of
                  Chancery</name>, where the endowment was insufficient for a classical school, to
                  substitute subjects of useful learning analogous to those contained in the
                  original trusts. As a result of this act a considerable number of ancient
                  endowments were reorganized so as to afford an improved elementary instead of an
                  inefficient classical education, and the schemes made under the act constituted an
                  early, but not very successful, experiment in the direction of higher elementary
                  schools.</p>

                  pupil-teacher system. The regulations of this year inaugurated annual maintenance
                  grants in the form of stipends for apprenticed pupil teachers receiving a
                  prescribed course of instruction under the head teacher, and a lower grade of
                  stipendiary monitors in schools where such instruction could not be provided.
                  These regulations inaugurated the system of Queen's Scholarships to assist pupil
                  teachers to proceed to a training college ; they also established capitation
                  grants for the support of such colleges, and annual grants to elementary schools
                  under government inspection of from £15 to £30 in aid of the salary of every
                  trained teacher employed. Provision was at the same time made for retiring

                  were made to establish a national system of elementary schools upon the basis of
                  rate-aid. These attempts began with the education clauses of <ref>

                                    </ref> of 1842, and were renewed in a series of bills from 1853 to 1857, of which
                  one set was introduced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Russell,_1st_Earl_Russell">Lord John
                    Russell</name> on behalf of the Whig government, whilst a second was promoted by

                    Committee on Education</name>, in the denominational interest, and a third set

                  one of these attempts which calls for notice here is the bill introduced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Russell,_1st_Earl_Russell">Lord John Russell</name> (called <title>the Borough Bill</title>, on account of
                  its being restricted to municipal boroughs) in 1853, and forming part of a
                  comprehensive scheme of legislative and administrative reform of which a portion
                  was actually carried into effect. The bill as a measure for elementary education
                  was supplemented by an administrative system of capitation grants for rural areas.
                  The government scheme also comprised a measure dealing with the administration of
                  charitable trusts (which took shape as <title>the Charitable Trusts Act
                    1853</title>), the constitution of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science_and_Art_Department">the Department of

                  commissions. The Borough Bill left it optional with municipalities to adopt the
                  act. It provided for the appointment of a school committee, one half of whose
                  members might be non-members of the council. The school committee was merely given
                  power to assist existing voluntary schools out of the rates. No provision was made
                  for public control beyond the requirement of audit; the sole condition as to
                  religious instruction was the acceptance of a conscience clause.</p>

                                <p>The failure of <title>the Borough Bill</title> did not affect the new system of
                  capitation grants which was introduced by minute of <name type="institution">the
                    Committee of Council</name> dated April 2, 1853. These grants were fixed at a
                  scale varying from 3s. to 6s. per head, payable upon certain conditions, of which
                  the most important were that the school must be under a certificated teacher, and
                  that three-fourths of the children must pass a prescribed examination. In
                  consequence of the failure of the several fresh bills introduced in 1855 by the
                  government, the church party and the secular party respectively amplifying the
                  proposals previously brought forward, the capitation grant was, by minute of
                  January 26, 1856, extended to urban areas. As in the case of all the early grants,
                  the regulations governing the distribution of the capitation grants were framed
                  upon the principle that subventions of public money must be met by local funds
                  derived from voluntary contributions, endowments and school fees; thus the basis
                  of the denominational system as fostered by the state at this stage was one of
                  financial partnership.</p>

                                <p>The progress of state-aided education during this period may be measured by the
                  increase of the annual parliamentary grant, which rose from £30,000 in 1839 to
                  £100,000 in 1846, £I50,000 in 1851, £396,000 in 1855, and £663,400 in l858. This
                  expansion was viewed with misgiving by the friends of the denominational system,
                  and by the strong individualist school of that day, who upon wider grounds clung
                  to the old ideal of voluntary initiative. These sections combined with the
                  advocates of further state intervention to press for a commission of inquiry, and
                  at the instance of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Pakington,_1st_Baron_Hampton">Sir John
                    Pakington</name> (the eminent Conservative educationist who was responsible for
                  the denominational bills of the fifties) a royal commission was appointed in 1858,
                  under the chairmanship of the duke of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newcastle_upon_Tyne">Newcastle</name>, to
                  inquire into the state of popular education in England, and to consider and report
                  what measures, if any, were required for the extension of sound and cheap
                  elementary instruction to all classes of the people. <title>The Report of the
                    Newcastle Commission</title>, issued in 1861, contains an exhaustive account of
                  the existing condition of elementary education, and, with due allowance for the
                  grave defects revealed, and in particular the glaring inefficiency of the numerous
                  little private-venture schools kept by <q>" dames"</q> and others, the graphic
                  picture drawn by the commissioners constitutes a striking tribute to the sterling
                  qualities of self-help and religious earnestness which were so characteristic of
                  the early Victorian period. It was found that in round numbers about 2,500,000
                  children were attending day schools, the proportion to population being 1 in 7, as
                  compared with 1 in 9 in France, 1 in 8 in Holland, and 1 in 6 in Prussia, where
                  education was compulsory. On the other hand, of this number only 1,675,000 were in
                  public schools of all kinds, only 1,100,000 in schools liable to inspection, and
                  917,000 in schools receiving annual grant. The result was that only one child in
                  every twenty was attending a school whose efficiency could be in any way
                  guaranteed by the state. In the constructive portion of their work the comments
                  and recommendations of the commissioners reflected the prevailing perplexity of
                  the public mind. A consistent individualistic minority considered that the annual
                  grant should be withdrawn altogether, and that any further state aid should be
                  confined to building grants, which they would concede not as desirable in
                  themselves but as necessitated out of considerations of fairness to the parishes
                  that had not yet received such aid. The commissioners as a body rejected free and
                  compulsory education in view of the religious difficulty and upon general grounds
                  of individualistic principle. Of the religious difficulty itself the commissioners
                  had some wise words to say which hold good in substance at the present time. In
                  their judgment the considerable evidence they had amassed conclusively proved that
                  the religious difficulty originated with the managers, promoters and organizers of
                  the schools, and not with the parents themselves ; yet the indifferent or
                  comparatively passive attitude of the people nowise materially diminished the
                  practical difficulty of introducing a comprehensive system, since it was not with
                  the body of the people but with the founders and supporters of schools that
                  legislators would always have to deal. In view of the solution adopted in 1902 it
                  is of interest to note that the Newcastle Commissioners deliberately rejected the
                  parish as unfit to be taken as the unit of elementary education upon the ground
                  that management by parochial ratepayers must tend to be illiberal and niggardly,
                  bent upon economy of the rates to the detriment of educational interests;
                  accordingly they recommended the constitution of county boards (which in the
                  absence of elective councils must needs originate with quarter sessions) clothed

                                <p>The one definite achievement of <name type="institution">the Newcastle
                    Commission</name> was the famous system of payment by results, which may be said
                  to have excited a keener and more prolonged controversy than any other measure of
                  a purely educational character. Impressed by the defects of the existing teaching,
                  the commissioners reported that there was only one way of securing efficiency, and
                  that was to institute a searching examination by competent authority of every
                  child in every school to which grants were to be paid, with the view of
                  ascertaining whether the indispensable elements of knowledge were thoroughly
                  acquired, and to make the prospects and position of the teacher dependent to a
                  considerable extent upon the results of this examination. Thus the commissioners
                  hoped to counteract what appeared to them to be the crying defect of the existing
                  training college system, viz. that it tended mainly to adapt the young
                  schoolmaster to advance his higher, rather than to thoroughly ground his junior,
                  pupils. They recognized that to raise the character of the children, both morally
                  and intellectually, was and must always be the highest aim of education, and they
                  were far from desiring to supersede this by any plan of a mere examination into
                  the more mechanical <pb n="975" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0975.png"/>
                  work of elementary education, the reading, writing and arithmetic of young
                  children; but they thought that the importance of this training, which must be the
                  foundation of all other teaching, had been lost sight of, and that there was
                  justice in the common complaint that while a fourth of the scholars were really
                  taught, three-fourths after leaving school forgot everything they had learnt
                  there.</p>

                                    </ref> In fact, it proved to be cheap ; the grant fell from £813,400 in 1861 to
                  £636,800 in 1865. The upholders of the existing system denounced <title>the

                  even as a breach of faith with the great religious denominations. On purely
                  educational grounds, which need not be here recapitulated, it was at once viewed
                  with misgiving by many authorities, including <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matthew_Arnold">Matthew Arnold</name>. To meet
                  objections, some modifications were introduced in the code under the Conservative
                  government in 1867. The system of paying grant upon the result of individual
                  examination of the scholars was not finally abolished till 1904.</p>

                  preparation for the great legislative measure for which the time was now felt to
                  have arrived. Good work was done in this direction by the Select Committee of
                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the
                    House of Commons</name> in 1866, over which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Pakington,_1st_Baron_Hampton">Sir John
                    Pakington</name> presided. For reasons connected with the political situation of
                  the moment this committee never reported, but the minutes of evidence and the
                  draft report prepared by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Pakington,_1st_Baron_Hampton">Sir John
                    Pakington</name> contained much valuable material in the way of criticism of the
                  existing system and suggestion for the coming settlement; in particular the draft
                  report insisted upon the inevitableness of an education rate. In 1868 the
                  Conservative government brought in, but did not proceed with, an education bill
                  deliberately discarding the principle of rate-aid on the ground that it would
                  destroy voluntary contributions and gradually starve out the denominational
                  schools. In 1867 and again in 1868 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Bruce,_1st_Baron_Aberdare">Mr Bruce

                    Algernon Egerton</name> introduced a bill which formed the basis of the measure

                    Bruce</name> and his coadjutors proposed a universal system of municipal and
                  parochial rating with liberty for voluntary schools to unite themselves to the
                  rate-aided system under their existing management, subject to the acceptance of a
                  conscience clause. The bill also proposed to empower town councils to co-opt
                  outsiders upon their education committees. Thus both in the principle of
                  co-optation and in the extension of rate-aid to schools not under public control
                  the bill of these Liberal statesmen in 1868 anticipated certain controverted

                  compromise. As <ref>

                    was <quote>" to complete the voluntary system and to fill up gaps,"</quote>
                                    </ref> not to supplant it. To this end <name type="institution">the Education
                    Department</name> was charged with the duty of ascertaining whether or not there
                  was in every parish a deficiency of public school accommodation, and provision
                  made for the formation of school boards in every school district (i.e. parish or
                  municipal borough) requiring further public school accommodation. Such
                  accommodation might consist either of public elementary schools as defined by the
                  act, or other schools giving efficient and suitable elementary education. The
                  definition of public elementary school contained in section 7 of the act is still
                  in force. Shortly, a public elementary school is a school subject to a conscience
                  clause entitling scholars to complete exemption from all religious instruction and
                  observance whatsoever. Any religious instruction or observance in the school must
                  be either at the beginning or the end of the school meeting. The school must also
                  be open at all times to the government inspectors and must be conducted in
                  accordance with the conditions required to be fulfilled in order to obtain an
                  annual parliamentary grant. In the same connexion an important change was made in
                  the conditions of inspection by declaring that it should be no part of the duties
                  of the inspector to inquire into religious instruction, whilst a later section of
                  the act provided that no parliamentary grant should be made in respect of any
                  religious instruction.</p>
                                <p>Three important changes were made in the measure during its passage through
                  parliament. As at first proposed, <list>
                                        <item>(1) the school boards were not to be directly elected by the ratepayers,
                      but were to be appointed by the town council or the vestry.</item>
                                        <item>(2) These nominated boards were empowered either to provide schools
                      themselves or to assist existing public elementary schools, provided that such
                      assistance was granted on equal terms to all such schools, upon conditions to
                      be approved by <name type="institution">the Education Department</name>. Thus
                      the school board, if it exercised the option of assisting denominational
                      schools, would have been obliged to assist all or none.</item>
                                        <item>(3) With regard to its own schools, the school board was to settle the
                      form of religious instruction.</item>
                                    </list> These proposals raised serious opposition in the country, and when the
                  committee stage of the bill was reached two fundamental changes were made in the
                  policy of the bill. In the first place, as <ref>
                                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Gladstone">Mr
                      Gladstone</name> put it, the government had decided <quote>" to sever
                      altogether the tie between the local board and the voluntary schools."</quote>
                                    </ref> In lieu of the suggested rate-aid they proposed an increased grant from
                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/HM_Treasury">the
                    treasury</name>, that is to say, the voluntary schools were left standing as
                  state-aided schools under private management, side by side with the new
                  rate-supported schools.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>

                                <p>Next, the character of the religious instruction in the board schools was
                  determined upon an undenominational basis by a provision which has become known to
                  history after the name of its author, then <ref>
                                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Mr Cowper-Temple</name>, as <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title> (section
                    14 of the act), directing that <quote>"no religious catechism or religious
                      formulary which is distinctive of any particular denomination shall be taught
                      in the school."</quote>
                                    </ref> The clause was not intended to exclude doctrinal exposition, and was in
                  fact a compromise not merely between absolute secularism and denominationalism,
                  but between denominationalism and the view of those who would have <title>the
                    Bible</title> read without note or comment. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apostles'_Creed">The Apostles' Creed</title> as
                  a symbol common to all denominations of Christians was held by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Edward_Forster">Mr Forster</name> (at
                  the suggestion of Mr Gladstone) not to be excluded under <title>the Cowper-Temple
                    clause</title>. The result was the establishment in the schools, upon the lines
                  laid down by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Joseph Lancaster</name> at
                  the beginning of the 19th century, of what may be termed the common Protestantism
                  of the English nation ; and though <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Disraeli">Mr Disraeli</name> urged
                  that a religion without formularies was in fact a new religion, and that in
                  leaving its exposition to the teachers we were creating a new sacerdotal class,
                  the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name> compromise, notwithstanding its inherent want of logic,
                  stood the test of experience for more than a generation against the consistent
                  denominationalists on the one hand and the party of secular education on the
                  other. It is important to observe that the act of 1870 left the giving of <pb n="976" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0976.png"/> religious instruction,
                  whether in voluntary schools (in which its inclusion might be assumed as of
                  course) or in board schools, purely permissive. In practice it was only in Wales
                  that school boards availed themselves to any extent of the liberty to abstain from
                  giving religious instruction, and this comparative secularism of Wales certainly
                  argued no lack of religious life among the people.</p>
                                <p>The third change in the bill was the substitution of the ad hoc school board for
                  the municipally appointed board originally proposed, a change which commended
                  itself in view of the special difficulty presented by the case of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name>. These
                  boards were elected by the system of cumulative voting under which each elector
                  had as many votes as there were candidates to be elected, with liberty to give all
                  his votes to one candidate or to distribute them amongst the candidates as he
                  thought fit. This system was much criticized as being unduly favourable to
                  minorities, whose representation it was devised to secure ; it continued, however,
                  until the supersession of the <foreign xml:lang="la">

                  1902</title>.</p>
                                <p>School boards were empowered not only to acquire sites for schools under powers
                  of compulsory purchase, but also to take transfers of existing voluntary schools
                  from their managers. The section which enables managers to transfer schools to the
                  school board or local education authority for the purpose of board or council
                  schools freed from religious trusts unquestionably marks an important inroad by
                  the state upon the sanctity of trusts. Thus though the act of 1870 did not itself
                  introduce the principle of compulsory transfer, it formed the point of departure
                  for the proposals in this direction which were the basis of the unsuccessful bills
                  of 1906 and 1908. The act of 1870 did not introduce either direct compulsory
                  attendance or free education, but it took a distinct step forward in each
                  direction by enabling school boards to frame by-laws rendering attendance
                  compulsory, and also to pay the school fees in the case of poverty of the
                  parent.</p>
                                <p>The policy of compromise between the two systems of voluntary and
                  rate-established schools was carried out in the provisions relating to the future
                  supply of schools. On the one hand, building grants were continued temporarily for
                  the benefit of those who applied (as voluntary managers alone could apply) before
                  the 31st of December 1870. On the other hand, <name type="institution">the
                    Education Department</name> was authorized to refuse parliamentary grants to
                  schools established in school board districts after the passing of the act if they
                  thought such schools unnecessary.</p>

                                <p>The following figures are of interest as showing the progress made under the act
                  of 1870. In the year 1870 there was accommodation in inspected day schools for
                  about 2,000,000 children ; the average attendance was 1,168,000, and the number on
                  the books about 1,500,000. It was computed, however, that there were, exclusive of
                  the well-to-do classes, at least 1,500,000 children who attended no school at all
                  or schools not under inspection. In 1876 accommodation had been provided for
                  nearly 3,500,000, and of the 1,500,000 new places nearly two-thirds were provided
                  by voluntary agencies. <ref>
                                        <quote>" These voluntary agencies," says <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sir_Henry_Craik,_1st_Baronet">Sir H.

                      schools they had built, the grants defraying about one-fifth of the cost of
                      the aided schools."</quote>
                                    </ref> On the other hand, the growth of school boards was rapid and continuous,
                  notwithstanding the permissive character of the act and the strenuous efforts of
                  the voluntaryists to keep pace with the new demands. In 1872, 9,700,000 of the
                  population were under school boards, and of these 8,142,000 were under by-laws; in
                  1876 the numbers were respectively 12,500,000 and 10,400,000. In the same period
                  the annual grants increased from £894,000 in 1870 to £1,600,000 in 1876.</p>

                  government in 1876 to take a notable step forward in the direction of universal
                  direct compulsion. The act of 1876 embodied the declaration that <quote>" it shall
                    be the duty of the parent of every child to cause such child to receive
                    efficient elementary instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic, and if such
                    parent fail to perform such duty he shall be liable to such orders and penalties
                    as are provided by the Act "</quote> ; next, it rendered an employer liable to a
                  penalty who took into his employment a child under the age of ten years, or a
                  child between the ages of ten and fourteen years who had not obtained the required
                  certificate of proficiency in reading, writing and arithmetic, or of previous
                  attendance at a certified efficient school. In order to complete the machinery for
                  compulsion, the act directed that, in every district where there was no school
                  board, a school attendance committee should be appointed by the local authority.
                  The law as to school attendance, resting upon this and subsequent enactments, is
                  complicated and in some details obscure. The subject was dealt with in the report
                  of an inter-departmental committee in 1900, who recommended the abolition of the
                  partial exemptions permitted, and the raising of the age of exemption to 13.</p>

                  universal direct compulsion. Under the acts of 1876 and 1880 the average

                                <p>With the passing of <title>the Elementary Education Act 1880</title> the
                  education question entered upon a new phase. The country was now possessed of a
                  national system of elementary education, in the sense that provision was made for
                  the supply of efficient schools and for compulsory attendance. The question of
                  free education was brought within the range of practical politics by the adoption
                  of universal compulsion, but as yet it was advocated only by a small political
                  group of pronounced collectivist tendencies. Whilst opinion was maturing on this
                  topic, there began to force itself upon the public mind the vastly more difficult
                  problem of combining the two systems of voluntary, denominational, state-aided
                  schools on the one hand, and public, undenominational, rate-supported schools on
                  the other. From the denominational point of view the problem presented itself as
                  that of a burden imposed and a danger threatened in ever-increasing degree by the
                  competition of the board schools, a competition that was felt not so much by
                  direct rivalry of school with school as indirectly by the steady raising of the
                  standard of efficiency with respect to buildings, equipment, salaries of teachers
                  and educational attainment which inevitably resulted from the establishment of
                  authorities with power to draw upon the rates. On the other hand, from the purely
                  educational point of view, it was seen that the dual system tended in practice to
                  an illicit but almost inevitable recognition of two standards of efficiency, the
                  lower being conceded to voluntary schools in consideration of their comparative
                  poverty. Experience, too, of the shortcomings of small country school boards was
                  beginning to confirm the misgivings entertained long before by the Newcastle
                  Commissioners as to the wisdom of entrusting autonomous powers to the parish, when
                  the reform of local government by the creation of popularly elected county
                  authorities turned attention once more to the question of organizing education
                  upon a county basis.</p>

                    Cross</name> was appointed to inquire into the working of the education acts.
                  The labours of this commission produced a thorough discussion of the educational
                  problem in all its aspects, political, administrative, scholastic and religious.
                  For any clear recommendations with regard to the reorganization of education
                  generally the moment was not opportune, inasmuch as the commission just preceded
                  the establishment of the new county authorities and the powers with respect to
                  instruction other than elementary which parliament was shortly to confide to them
                  under <title>the Technical Instruction Acts</title>. Nevertheless the report of
                  the majority of the <pb n="977" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0977.png"/>
                  commissioners pointed unmistakably towards the solution adopted in <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>,
                  and their definite recommendation that voluntary schools should be accorded
                  rate-aid without the imposition of <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title>, served
                  as the basis of that legislation. The commission brought into strong relief the
                  opposing currents of thought in educational politics, the majority report,
                  representing the principles of denominationalism, being balanced by a strong
                  minority report embodying the views of those who looked for progress along the
                  lines of the school-board system. Taken together, the two reports form a
                  comprehensive survey of the difficulties which still in the main beset public
                  education in this country.</p>

                  chronological sequence, the practical establishment of free education by the act
                  of l891 not by the absolute prohibition of school fees but by the device of a
                  special grant payable by parliament in lieu of fees, called the fee grant. The
                  result of this legislation and of subsequent administrative action was to place
                  free education within the reach of every child, fees being retained (with few
                  exceptions) only where some instruction of a higher elementary type was given.</p>

                  which affected secondary education as well as technical education in the proper

                  secondary education a generation earlier.</p>

                      Bryce</name>'s Commission of 1894)</ref> remains the best introduction to the
                  problem of public secondary education in England. The existence of numerous and
                  frequently very wealthy endowments arising from private benefactions and bequests
                  has at all times been a feature in education as in other departments of English
                  social life. In the organization of secondary education in particular, private
                  endowments have played and continue still to play a part which cannot be
                  paralleled in any other country. This circumstance has undoubtedly resulted in a
                  great economy of resources, though in numerous instances the difficulties
                  occasioned by the haphazard distribution of endowments and the local jealousies
                  invariably aroused by any attempt to readjust their areas to modern conditions
                  have obstructed useful reform and proved a source of misdirected and wasted
                  effort. At the date of <name type="institution">the Schools Inquiry
                    Commission</name> the state of the ancient endowments was largely one of abuse.
                  Very many endowments intended for advanced education were applied for instruction
                  of a purely elementary character, and that of an inferior kind ; indeed the
                  possession of an endowment in a rural locality not infrequently operated to
                  prevent the establishment of an efficient state-aided school. The evidence showed
                  that the proportion of scholars in the country grammar-schools who were receiving
                  some tincture of the classical education intended by the founders was steadily
                  decreasing, and nothing had been done to bring the curriculum into harmony with
                  the actual needs of the time. No doubt a small elite of classical scholars were
                  sent to the older universities by these schools, but in the main they were in a
                  feeble and decadent state, giving, more or less inefficiently, an education wholly
                  unsuited to the wants of the class to whom they ministered. In addition to the
                  general inelasticity of the curriculum, the special evils from which the
                  grammar-schools suffered were the want of effective governing bodies and the
                  freehold tenure of the headmasterships.</p>

                    Act</title>, which was based upon its recommendations and conferred upon a

                    Commission</name>) very wide and drastic powers of reorganizing ancient
                  endowments. A direction for extending the benefits of endowments to girls did much
                  to assist the movement for the secondary education of girls. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endowed_Schools_Act_1869">The Endowed Schools
                    Acts 1869-1874</title> introduced modifications of importance and general
                  interest into the law of trusts. Under the existing rules of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_Chancery">the court
                    of chancery</name>, which rules were also binding upon the Charity
                  Commissioners, educational endowments were generally treated, in the absence of
                  evidence to the contrary, as subject to a trust for instruction in the doctrines
                  of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Church of England</name>. Under <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endowed_Schools_Act_1869">the Endowed Schools

                  from denominational restrictions, save in virtue of express conditions imposed by
                  or under the authority of the founder. The result was that in framing schemes for
                  the reorganization of ancient endowed schools the commissioners found themselves
                  able to treat the majority of cases as undenominational. In such cases the general
                  practice was to direct that instruction should, subject to a strict conscience
                  clause, be given in the principles of the Christian faith; this provision
                  corresponded in a way to <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title> in elementary
                  education, with the important distinction that it was positive, not negative, and
                  did not exclude special doctrinal instruction.</p>

                  also submitted proposals for the general administrative organization of a system
                  of secondary education. They recommended the establishment of three authorities— <list>
                                        <item>(1) a central authority;</item>
                                        <item>(2) a local or provincial authority, representing the county or a group of
                      counties, with a certain jurisdiction both in proposing schemes for the reform
                      of endowed schools in their area (such as that afterwards conferred upon the
                      joint education committees under <name type="institution">the Welsh
                        Intermediate Education Act</name>), and in administering these
                      schools;</item>
                                        <item>and (3) a central council of education charged with examination
                      duties</item>
                                    </list>. Further, it was proposed to raise the level of proprietary and private
                  schools by offering them inspection and examination and by establishing a system
                  of school registration. Lastly, in order that the supply of public secondary
                  schools might not be dependent upon endowments, it was proposed to confer upon
                  towns and parishes powers of rating for the establishment of new schools. For
                  these proposals as a whole the time was not ripe. The bill of 1869 as originally
                  introduced in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name>
                  attempted to give effect, with some variations, <pb n="978" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0978.png"/> to one of these suggestions,
                  namely, that for the creation of a central council, but exigencies of
                  parliamentary time made it necessary to drop this part of the measure ; the result
                  was that the plan of the commissioners was only half carried out. Nevertheless,
                  owing to the multiplicity and wealth of endowments, the work accomplished was
                  sufficient to exert a considerable influence upon the secondary education of the
                  country. Thus in 1895 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bryce,_1st_Viscount_Bryce">Mr
                    Bryce</name>'s Commission was able to report that schemes under <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endowed_Schools_Act_1869">the Endowed Schools
                    Acts</title> had been made for 902 endowments in England, excluding Wales and

                  leaving only 546 endowments out of the total of 1448 endowments in England known

                  of the commissioners. The total income of the endowments known to be subject to

                  the creation by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Local_Government_Act_1888">the Local Government Act 1888</title> of the representative and popular county
                  authorities of which the need had been felt by reformers alike in secondary and
                  elementary education, rendered the first step in the direction of the
                  municipalization of secondary instruction at last possible. In 1889 <title>the
                    Technical Instruction Act</title> (extended in some particulars by an act of
                  1891) empowered the councils of counties, boroughs and urban districts to levy a
                  rate (not exceeding a penny in the pound) for the support or aid of technical or
                  manual instruction. Comparatively few councils were prepared to resort to their
                  rating powers, but progress under these acts was greatly facilitated by <title>the
                    Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act of 1890</title>, which mentioned
                  technical instruction as one of the purposes to which the imperial contribution
                  paid to local authorities in respect of the beer and spirit duties might be
                  applied. By virtue of the very liberal interpretation given to technical
                  instruction by these acts the financial assistance afforded under them was
                  extended to cover the whole field of mathematical and physical science, as well as
                  modern languages.</p>

                  women. In the main the influence of these new institutions made for a

                                <p>At the same time, the pressure of the school boards influenced secondary
                  education in two ways. In the first place, the elementary schools were found to
                  act as feeders for schools of a higher type, and the idea of the <q>" educational
                    ladder "</q> began to play a leading part in plans for the organization of
                  national education. It was seen that there must be schools to which the more
                  advanced scholars could pass from the public elementary schools, and scholarships
                  to assist such scholars to continue their education in this way. In the next
                  place, it was recognized that to provide adequately for the further education of
                  public elementary scholars a new type of school was required. Thus there came into
                  being through the initiative of the great school boards what were known as
                  higher-grade elementary schools. These were really secondary schools of the third
                  grade, and, as <name type="institution">the Commission on Secondary

                  educational void which the Schools Inquiry Commissioners had proposed to fill by
                  schools of that name. The happy obscurity of the legal definition of elementary
                  education left these schools free to develop during the long years of the neglect
                  of secondary education by the state, and when in 1901 the famous judgment in the
                  test case of <title>

                                    </title> pronounced them to be illegal, it was at once recognized that the
                  legislature must without delay step in to secure the educational work which the
                  undoubtedly correct principles of judicial interpretation had placed in
                  jeopardy.</p>

                                <p>Such were the agencies at work in the domain of secondary education when in 1894
                  a royal commission was appointed under the presidency of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bryce,_1st_Viscount_Bryce">Mr
                    Bryce</name> to inquire into this branch of education. The terms of reference
                  excluded elementary education, and the report may be taken as embodying the views
                  of that school of educational statesmen who held that progress would best be
                  attained by keeping elementary and secondary education entirely separate for
                  purposes of local administration, the parish being regarded as the natural unit
                  for elementary and the county for secondary education, a topic to which it will be
                  necessary to revert in connexion with <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>.
                  The principal recommendations of the commission were: <list>
                                        <item>(1) the unification of the existing central authorities, viz. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science_and_Art_Department">the Department
                        of Science and Art</name>, <name type="institution">the Charity
                        Commission</name> (so far as it dealt with educational endowments), and
                        <name type="institution">the Education Department</name>, in one central
                      office, and the establishment of an educational council to advise the minister
                      of education in certain professional matters;</item>
                                        <item>(2) the establishment of local authorities, to consist of committees of
                      the county councils with co-opted elements ;</item>
                                        <item>(3) the formation of a register of teachers with a view to the
                      encouragement of professional training, and a system of school registration
                      upon the basis of inspection and examination</item>
                                    </list>. The first of these recommendations was carried out by <name type="institution">the Board of Education Act 1899</name>, as mentioned below,
                  and under the same act an attempt was made to give some effect to the third-named
                  object, which, though it unfortunately fell short of success, may serve as a point
                  of departure for further efforts. The realization of the second, and the most
                  important, of the recommendations was deferred till 1902, when it was brought
                  about as a part of a wider reorganization of the educational system.</p>

                    Bryce</name>'s Commission in 1895 once more reached an acute stage, and this
                  circumstance was immediately unfavourable to a resolute handling of educational
                  problems as such, public attention being largely concentrated upon the voluntary
                  demand of the supporters of voluntary schools for relief from the growing
                  financial burden which was laid upon them by that steady raising of the standard
                  to which reference has been made above. In 1896 an endeavour was made to meet the
                  demands of the voluntary managers by means of a bill introduced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Eldon_Gorst">Sir John
                    Gorst</name> on behalf of the Conservative government. This bill with its
                  provision for a special aid grant to be administered by county education
                  authorities, which were to exist side by side with the school boards, represented
                  a kind of compromise between the systems of 1870 and 1902. It encountered
                  opposition in all quarters and was withdrawn. In 1897, however, the position of
                  the denominational schools was strengthened by <title>the Voluntary Schools
                    Act</title>, which provided for a special aid grant of five shillings per head
                  of the scholars in average attendance in these schools.</p>

                                <p>No law of recent years has excited an acuter or more prolonged controversy than
                    <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the Education Act of
                    1902</title>, and amid the dust of religious and political strife it is not easy
                  for contemporaries to view it objectively and in its true proportions.
                  Nevertheless, considered historically, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title> becomes
                  intelligible as the product of the forces, partly religious and partly
                  educational, which have been already described. The immediate impulse for this
                  measure must be sought in the agitation that during the preceding decade had been
                  gathering force among the adherents of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Established</name> and
                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">Roman Catholic</name> churches for equality of financial treatment as between
                  voluntary and board schools. It must be placed to the credit of the constructive
                  statesmanship of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_(UK)">the Conservative
                    party</name> that it availed itself of an ecclesiastical agitation to take an
                  important step forward in the organization of national education. The difficulty
                  inherent in such a measure was the admitted difficulty of securing public control,
                  as a necessary concomitant of public maintenance, without jeopardizing or
                  destroying the special religious character of the voluntary schools. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">The act of 1902</title>
                  sought to solve this problem, so difficult of solution under democratic
                  conditions, upon the principle of a division of financial responsibility
                  justifying a corresponding division of control between the voluntary managers and
                  the local authority. The constitution of the local authority to be charged not
                  only with the delicate duty of participating in the dual control of the voluntary
                  public elementary schools, but also with the responsible task of co-ordinating
                  public higher with public elementary education, presented features of controversy
                  only less formidable than the purely religious question itself. Boldly reversing
                  the settlement of 1870, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>
                  abolished the parochial school boards, and with them the system of <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                        <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>
                                    </foreign> election, and made the county councils, already seised of technical and
                  secondary education under <title>the Technical Instruction Acts</title>, the local
                  authorities for all forms of education, thus reverting to the solution propounded
                  by Conservative statesmanship in the middle period of the 19th century and
                  endorsed by an important memorandum contributed by <name type="person">Lord
                    Sandford</name> (formerly permanent secretary of <name type="institution">the
                    Education Department</name>) to the report of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/R._A._Cross,_1st_Viscount_Cross">Cross</name>
                  Commission. The unquestionable niggardliness and inefficiency of many small
                  country school boards, which had been foretold by the prescience of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newcastle_upon_Tyne">Newcastle</name> Commissioners, constituted the chief educational argument for
                  the selection of the wider area so far as the interests of elementary education
                  alone were concerned. On the other hand, experience has shown that in the rural
                  districts against the undoubted gain in general efficiency there must be set a
                  certain loss on account of the decay of local and personal interest consequent
                  upon the centralization of authority in the hands of the county councils. Account,
                  too, must be taken of the comparative heaviness with which a uniform county rate
                  is apt to press upon sparsely populated agricultural parishes, especially in
                  counties which include considerable industrial districts. Notwithstanding these
                  minor drawbacks, it may be said that upon the whole the best opinion has endorsed
                  the policy of 1902 with respect to the area of administration. At any rate it has
                  been necessary to recognize the impracticability of disestablishing the strongly
                  organized provincial authorities which <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title> brought
                  into being, and proposals for amendment in this particular have been confined to
                  schemes, favoured in principle by all parties, for securing some measure of
                  decentralization and delegation of powers calculated to restore and stimulate
                  local interest without derogating from the financial and administrative
                  responsibility of the county council.</p>

                                                        <item>(a) Powers. The L.E.A. are required to maintain and keep efficient
                              all public elementary schools which were necessary (i.e. which, as
                              defined by § 9, have an average attendance of not less than thirty),
                              under certain specified conditions, of which the most material are as
                              follows. The managers must carry out the directions of the L.E.A. as
                              to the secular instruction to be given in the school, including any
                              directions with respect to the number and educational qualifications
                              of the teachers, and for the dismissal of any teacher on educational
                              grounds (§ 7 [1] [a]). The consent of the L.E.A. is required to the

                              on educational grounds; and the consent of the authority is also

                                                        <item>(b) Liabilities. The managers are required to provide the school
                              premises to the L.E.A, for use as a public elementary school free of
                              charge, except that a rent is payable for the teacher's residence
                              where one exists; and the managers are further required out of funds
                              provided by them to keep the school premises in good repair and to
                              make such alterations and improvements in the buildings as might
                              reasonably be required by the L.E.A. On the other hand, the L.E.A, are
                              required to make good such damage as they consider to be due to fair
                              wear and tear of rooms used by them (§ 7 [1] [d]).</item>

                                <p>A provision, § 7 (6), known from the name of its author (d. 1908), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Colonel
                    Kenyon Slaney, M.P.</name>, as the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Kenyon-Slaney</name>
                  clause, attracted considerable attention and formed the subject of much
                  ecclesiastical controversy during the passage of the bill through parliament. The
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Kenyon-Slaney</name> clause requires the religious instruction in voluntary
                  schools to be in accordance with the provisions (if any) of the trust deed, but
                  also to be under the control of the managers as a whole, whereas the common form
                  of trust deed of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Society_for_Promoting_Religious_Education">the National Society</name> reserves the control of religious instruction to
                  the clergyman, whilst the clause was equally in conflict with the well-known
                  sacerdotal principles of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Catholic
                    Church</name>. Thus the clause represented a revival, as did the questions with
                  respect to foundation managers, of the early controversy over the management
                  clauses of <name type="institution">the Committee of Council on Education</name>.
                  Its special interest lies, not so much in its intrinsic importance, as in the
                  precedent it affords, specially notable as emanating from a Conservative source,
                  for the overruling of trust deeds upon grounds of public policy. By way of saving
                  another familiar provision of the trust deeds, a proviso to the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Kenyon-Slaney</name> clause reserves the existing trust-deed rights of appeal
                  to the bishop or other denominational authority as to the character of the
                  religious instruction.</p>

                  either by the L.E.A. or any other persons, subject to the issue of three months'
                  public notice, and to a right of appeal on the part of the managers of any
                  existing school, the L.E.A. (in the case of proposed voluntary schools) or any ten
                  ratepayers of the district, to <name type="institution">the Board of
                    Education</name> on the ground that the proposed school is not required, or that
                  a school provided by the L.E.A., or not so provided, as the case might be, is
                  better suited to meet the wants of the district than the proposed school. Any
                  enlargement of a public elementary school which in the opinion of <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> is such as to amount to the
                  provision of a new school is to be so treated for the purposes of the section, and
                  any transfer of a school to or from the L.E.A. must be treated as the provision of
                  a new school. In deciding appeals as to new schools and in determining a case of
                  dispute whether a school was necessary or not, <name type="institution">the
                    board</name> are directed to have regard to the interest of secular instruction,
                  the wishes of parents as to the education of children, and the economy of the
                  rates, but existing schools are not to be considered unnecessary if the average
                  attendance is not less than thirty (§§ 8-9). The last-mentioned canons have played
                  a prominent part in subsequent discussions. Experience of these sections has shown
                  that though it is extremely difficult to set up new voluntary schools in face of
                  opposition from the L.E.A., such opposition is rarely offered or pressed where any
                  really strong local demand is shown to exist.</p>

                  maintained by them. This new grant, calculated by an elaborate method which need
                  not here be set out, took the place of the grants under <title>the Voluntary

                  Nonconformist views. Accordingly the government passed <title>the Local Education
                    (Local Authority Default) Act 1904</title>, empowering <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>, in the case of default by the local authority,
                  to make payments direct to the managers of the school and to deduct the amount
                  from the sums payable to the defaulting authority on account of parliamentary
                  grants.</p>

                    1902-1903</title>, with the object of securing full public control of all
                  rate-aided schools and the appointment of teachers without reference to religious
                  belief. The bill was of a highly complex character; its principal features
                  were,—compulsory transfer of existing voluntary schools to the local authority,
                  facilities for the giving of denominational instruction in transferred schools out
                  of school hours by persons other than the regular teachers, and the recognition in
                  populous districts, upon the demand of parents, of special publicly maintained
                  schools in which denominational teaching could be included in the curriculum ; the
                  latter schools might (according to the bill as finally amended) in the last
                  resort, i.e. if the local authority refused to maintain them, be recognized as
                  state-aided schools. The bill encountered strong opposition from Anglicans and
                  Catholics (though the Catholic Irish members finally voted for it as amended); it
                  passed <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name> by a large majority, but after unavailing attempts

                    out."</q> In single-school parishes the existing schools were to be compulsorily
                  transferred, subject to the grant of denominational facilities out of school
                  hours; elsewhere a sufficiency of places in schools with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name> teaching, which the bill proposed to make compulsory in
                  all provided schools, must be supplied by the local authority, while existing
                  voluntary schools might become state-aided schools upon terms of receiving a grant
                  of 47s. per head. The bill was accompanied by a financial scheme for a new system
                  of allocating the parliamentary grant. In view of the improbability of its passing
                  into law the bill was <pb n="981" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0981.png"/>
                  not pressed beyond the stage of second reading. Meanwhile, when <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/H._H._Asquith">Mr Asquith</name>
                  reorganized the cabinet, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Runciman,_1st_Viscount_Runciman_of_Doxford">Mr Runciman</name> succeeded <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reginald_McKenna">Mr McKenna</name> at the
                  education office, and in the autumn he introduced a fresh measure framed as the
                  result of negotiations between the government and the archbishop of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canterbury">Canterbury</name>

                  parliament by consent of all parties. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Runciman,_1st_Viscount_Runciman_of_Doxford">Mr Runciman</name>'s bill, like his predecessor's, was based upon the principle
                  of compulsory transfer in single-school parishes and contracting out elsewhere,
                  but it gave a right of entry for denominational teaching on two days a week during
                  school hours in all council schools whether transferred voluntary schools or
                  otherwise, with liberty to employ for this purpose assistant teachers, but not
                  (save temporarily at first in transferred schools) head teachers. Provision was
                  also made for the payment of a small rent which would be applicable for or towards
                  the cost of the denominational instruction. Unfortunately, the compromise failed
                  at the last moment for want of agreement as to the financial terms cf <q>"
                    contracting out,"</q> the government offering 50s. per head and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the
                    Church</name> demanding 7s. more. It is obvious that <q>" contracting out "</q>
                  is open to serious objection upon educational and economic grounds, and that if
                  resorted to upon any very considerable scale it would involve a disruption of the
                  public elementary system, and a duplication of schools which would constitute a
                  wasteful drain upon the national exchequer. Upon such a system, therefore, some
                  check is necessary, and, once decided that the check should take the form of
                  financial pressure, rather than request of parents as in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_Birrell">Mr Birrell</name>'s bill, or
                  some form of administrative control, the question of pecuniary terms became one of
                  principle and not merely of financial detail. Moreover, the difficulty of
                  adjusting differences was intensified by the opposition of the extremists on
                  either side, which daily gathered force, and the bill was withdrawn by the
                  government when in committee of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name>.
                  The conciliatory efforts of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Runciman,_1st_Viscount_Runciman_of_Doxford">Mr Runciman</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randall_Davidson,_1st_Baron_Davidson_of_Lambeth">Dr Randall Davidson</name> revealed the existence of a considerable body of
                  influential opinion among all schools of thought in favour of a national
                  compromise, and the proposals embodied in the bill marked on the part both of
                  Churchmen and Nonconformists important concessions to each other's views,
                  engendering reasonable hopes of an ultimate settlement being reached at no distant
                  date.</p>

                                <p>Two subsidiary points as regards educational machinery have to be noted. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_(Provision_of_Meals)_Act_1906">The
                    Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906</title> enabled local education
                  authorities to aid voluntary agencies in the provision of meals for children
                  attending public elementary schools, and in certain cases with the consent of
                    <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> to defray the cost of the
                  food themselves. In 1907-1908 forty, and in 1908-1909 seventy-five authorities in

                      Joshua Fitch</name>, in his article on education in the 10th edition of this

                      <quote>" in place of testing the proficiency of individual scholars, ... one

                  largely removed such dangers as were to be apprehended from the relaxation in
                  question. Thus it was possible for <name type="institution">the Board of
                    Education</name> in the code of 1904 to abolish the last traces of the system of
                  payment by results, by setting forth (in the language of their report for
                  1903-1904) <quote>" a properly co-ordinated curriculum suitable to the needs of
                    the children, with an indication of the relation which the various subjects of
                    instruction should bear to each other, in place of the relatively haphazard list
                    of possible branches of knowledge which were formerly presented to the choice of
                    individual schools or authorities."</quote> In the new code also the board for
                  the first time endeavoured to state for the guidance of teachers and parents the
                  proper aim of the public elementary school, laying stress upon that element of the
                  training of character which the system of payment by results had so unfortunately
                  obscured. The new spirit was strikingly manifested in the volume of <title>
                                        <hi rend="italic">Suggestions for the Considerations of Teachers</hi>
                                    </title>, issued by <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> in
                  1905. This volume represented a notable attempt to connect administration with
                  educational theory, without in any way seeking to crush individual initiative, or
                  to impose a bureaucratic uniformity of method upon those engaged in the actual
                  work of the schools. Apprehension of the true aim of elementary education as
                  essentially and primarily a preparation for practical life has led to a
                  corresponding development of instruction of a practical character, observation
                  lessons and nature study being treated as a necessary element in the curriculum,
                  while handicraft and gardening, and domestic subjects (for girls), are encouraged
                  by special grants. Particular attention has been bestowed both by the central and
                  local authorities upon the problem of rural instruction, and much has been done in
                  many areas to bring the schools into closer relations with the needs of
                  agricultural and rural life generally. In this way the old and perhaps not
                  altogether ill-founded distrust of popular education as tending to unfit the
                  working classes for industrial pursuits is being broken down and a public opinion
                  more favourable to educational progress in the widest sense is being created.</p>
                                <p>According to the official returns for 1907-1908, the total number of scholars on
                  the registers (England only) was as follows: —council schools, 2,991,741;
                  voluntary schools, 2,566,030; total, 5,557,771, and the total attendance upon
                  which grant was paid was 4,928,659. The percentage of actual average attendance to
                  average number on the registers was 88-50%. The parliamentary grant (England and
                  Wales) for elementary schools, other than higher elementary, amounted to
                  £11,023,433.</p>

                  the succeeding years provision was made in the code for higher elementary schools

                  practice in schools for those students who desired to become teachers. Thus the

                  became more and more a subject of controversy and of public interest, as indicated

                                <p>The question of the preliminary education of elementary teachers had after some
                  years of discussion reached a critical stage in 1909. The history of pupil
                  teachership as a method of concurrent instruction and employment shows that it was
                  in its inception something in the nature of a makeshift; the ideal placed before
                  local education authorities in the recent regulations and reports of <ref>

                    whereby with the aid of national bursaries (instituted in 1907) <quote>" the
                      general education of future teachers may be continued in secondary schools
                      until the age of seventeen or eighteen, and all attempts to obtain a practical
                      experience of elementary school work may be deferred until the training
                      college is entered, or at least until an examination making a natural break in
                      that general education and qualifying for an admission to a training college

                                    </ref> Under the revised pupil-teacher system established by the regulations of
                  1903 provision is made for the instruction of pupil teachers in centres which as
                  far as possible are attached to secondary schools receiving grants from <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> under the regulations for
                  secondary schools, about two-thirds of the secondary schools on the grant list
                  undertaking this work. Accordingly, the result of recent changes is to modify the
                  old system in two ways: first by providing the alternative of a full course of
                  secondary education, secondly by associating pupil teachership itself as far as
                  possible with part-time attendance at a secondary school. The total number of
                  pupil teachers recognized during the year 1907-1908 was 20,571, and of these 9770
                  were in centres forming integral parts of secondary schools. The number of bursars
                  who passed the leaving examination was 1486.</p>

                                <p>One of the principal difficulties which confronted the state and the local
                  authorities in their task of organizing an improved system of public education
                  under <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of
                    1902</title> lay in the deficiency of training colleges in view of the increased
                  number of teachers. Local authorities naturally hesitated to burden themselves
                  with the cost of providing such institutions in view of the fact that there is
                  nothing to prevent teachers trained at great expense by one authority taking
                  service under a less public-spirited authority who had contributed nothing to such
                  training ; hence a widespread feeling that the provision of training colleges
                  should be undertaken by the state as a matter of national concern. Under these
                  circumstances a new system of building grants in aid of the establishment of
                  training colleges was instituted in 1905. In 1906 these grants were raised from 25
                  to 75 % of the capital expenditure, but were limited to colleges provided by local
                  authorities. A further difficulty in view of the municipalization of education
                  arose from the fact that the majority of the residential colleges were in the
                  hands of denominational trusts which did not admit a conscience clause. Under the

                      by public funds to all students who are qualified to profit by it irrespective

                  recognized except on terms of compliance with certain conditions as to freedom
                  from denominational restrictions or requirements. The obligation as to religious

                  expenditure upon elementary education is wasted for want of an effective system of
                  continuative instruction to be given out of working hours to adolescents engaged
                  in industrial employment. The whole subject was exhaustively <pb n="983" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0983.png"/> treated by the report in 1909 of
                    <name type="institution">the Consultative Committee</name> of <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>. This report seeks to base an
                  efficient continuative system upon the improvement of elementary education by
                  reducing the size of the classes in the elementary schools upon the lines now laid
                  down by the new staffing regulations of 1909; by increasing the amount of
                  instruction in hand-work with a view to rendering the curriculum less bookish and
                  more efficient as a training for industrial and agricultural life; and by
                  legislation to reform the system of half-time attendance and raise the age of
                  compulsory attendance to thirteen and ultimately fourteen. Upon the foundation of
                  an improved and prolonged elementary education there would be reared a
                  superstructure of continuative schools or classes, attendance at which up to
                  seventeen would be compulsory under bye-laws adoptive locally at the option of the
                  local education authorities. In 1906-1907 about 21 per thousand of the population
                  of England and Wales attended evening schools and classes inspected by <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>, and grant amounting to

                                <p>The most marked progress has undoubtedly been in secondary education, and in no

                    of 1902</title> proved more fruitful. At the end of the 19th century secondary
                  instruction in England was still provided chiefly by endowed grammar-schools, by
                  proprietary schools established by religious bodies or joint-stock companies, and
                  by private enterprise. No public provision was made for secondary education as
                  such; what financial assistance was forthcoming from municipal sources was given
                  indirectly under cover of the grants under <title>the Technical Instruction
                    Acts</title>, while in the administration of central grants for the first years
                  of the working of <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>
                                    <title>Act 1899</title>, no absolute differentiation between secondary and
                  technological functions was recognized. The establishment of local authorities
                  with direct duties in respect of secondary education, and the reorganization of
                  the central office with reference to the three branches of education, elementary,
                  secondary and technological, rendered possible for the first time an adequate
                  treatment of the problem of public secondary education as a whole. <ref>

                        Art Department</name>. Detached science classes were gradually built up into
                      schools of science. Schools of science were subsequently widened into schools
                      of what was known as the <q>' Division A '</q> type, providing a course of
                      instruction in science in connexion with, and as part of, a course of general

                  on the other hand the tendency (marked especially by the regulations of 1907) to
                  greater elasticity in regard to curricula, and so to the freer encouragement of
                  local initiative and local effort.</p>
                                <p>In 1907 the government of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Campbell-Bannerman">Sir Henry
                    Campbell-Bannerman</name> placed greatly increased funds at the disposal of
                    <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> for the purpose of
                  secondary education. The regulations under which the increased grant was
                  administered imposed conditions in respect of freedom from denominational
                  restrictions or requirements, representative local control, and accessibility to
                  all classes of the people, which, like the analogous rules with regard to training
                  colleges, roused considerable controversy. With regard to religious instruction,
                  the requirement was made that no catechism or formulary distinctive of any
                  particular religious denomination might be taught in the school except upon the
                  request in writing of the parent or guardian and at the cost of funds other than
                  grants of public money. Power was at the same time reserved to <name type="institution">the board</name> to waive the new conditions in the event of
                  the local education authority passing a resolution that the school was in their
                  view required as part of the secondary school provision for their area, and that
                  the conditions, or one or more of them, might be waived with advantage in view of
                  the educational needs of the area. It will be noticed that one effect of the
                  regulations (as of the training college regulations) was to recognize as a kind of
                  established religion those elements of Christianity which are shared in common by
                  the various Protestant churches, according to the system of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> and the
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name> compromise. Normally schools are required to provide 25 %
                  of free places for scholars from public elementary schools, and, with a view to
                  encouraging the transference of children from the public elementary school at an
                  early age, a grant of £2 was made payable on account of ex-public elementary
                  scholars between ten and twelve years of age. The full scale of grants is £2 for
                  ex-public elementary scholars between ten and twelve, and £5 for scholars between
                  twelve and eighteen. To schools previously recognized and failing to comply with
                  the new conditions, grant may be paid on the lower scale of £2 and £2, 10s.
                  respectively.</p>
                                <p>Secondary school grants are assessed upon average attendance, and efficiency is
                  guaranteed by inspection and not by individual examination. All recognized schools
                  must provide at least the substantial equivalent of the four-years' course
                  formerly required, and recognition is withheld or withdrawn if an adequate number
                  of the scholars do not remain at least four years in the school, or do not remain
                  up to sixteen ; in rural areas, however, and small towns, a school life of three
                  years and a leaving age of fifteen may be accepted. <ref>

                  especially the religious conditions of England and Wales respectively, Wales
                  continued to be treated as one with England for purposes of educational
                  administrationdown to quite recent years. Towards the end of the 19th century the
                  striking revival of Welsh nationality, in itself largely an educational and a
                  literary movement, led to a spontaneous demand among the Welsh people for the
                  organization of a national system of higher education. In accordance with the
                  recommendations of a special royal commission <title>the Welsh Intermediate
                    Education Act</title> passed in 1889 provided for the creation in every county
                  in Wales (including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monmouthshire">Monmouthshire</name>) of joint
                  education committees consisting of three nominees of the county council and two
                  nominees of the lord president of the council. To these committees were entrusted
                  the duties of framing (under the Charity Commissioners) schemes for the
                  establishment of intermediate <pb n="984" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0984.png"/> and technical schools and for the
                  application of endowments, and for administering a 1/2 d. county rate, which was
                  supplemented by a treasury grant not exceeding the amount raised by the rate.

                                    <hi rend="italic">History.</hi>—The first white settlers who came to North America
                  were typical representatives of those European peoples who had made more progress
                  in civilization than any other in the world. Those settlers, in particular those
                  from England and from Holland, brought with them the most advanced ideas of the
                  time on the subject of education. The conditions of life in the New World
                  emphasized the need of schools and colleges, and among the earliest public acts of
                  the settlers were provisions to establish them. The steps taken between 1619 and
                  1622 to provide schools for the colony of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virginia">Virginia</name> were frustrated by
                  the Indian war which broke out in the latter year, and were never successfully
                  renewed during the colonial period. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name>, where the
                  influence of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people">the Dutch</name> was at, first predominant, elementary schools were maintained
                  at the public expense, and were intended for the education of all classes of the
                  population. This policy reflected the very advanced views as to public elementary
                  education which were then held in the Netherlands. The assumption of control in
                  the colony of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name> by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_people">the English</name> was a
                  distinct check to the development of public elementary education, and little or no
                  further progress was made until after the Revolution. The most systematic
                  educational policy was pursued in the colony of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name>. As early
                  as 1635, five years after it was founded, the town of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston">Boston</name> took action to the end
                  that <quote>" our brother <name type="person">Philemon Pormort</name> shall be
                    entreated to become schoolmaster for the teaching and nurturing children with
                    us."</quote>
                                    <name type="institution">The General Court</name> of the colony in 1636 made the
                  first appropriation for what was to become <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_College">Harvard College</name>, taking
                  its name in honour of the minister, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Harvard_(clergyman)">John Harvard</name>,
                  who died in 1638, leaving his library and one-half of his property, having a value
                  of £800, to the new institution. The amount of this appropriation of 1636 (£400)
                  was remarkable in that it was probably equal to the whole colony tax for a year.
                  In 1642 followed a legislative act which, while saying nothing of schools, gave to
                  the selectmen in every town power to oversee both the education and the employment
                  of children. It is made the duty of the selectmen to see that the children can
                  read and understand the principles of religion and the capital laws of the
                  country, and that they are put to some useful work.</p>
                                <p>Five years later, in 1647, was enacted the law which is not only the real
                  foundation of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> school
                  system, but the type of later legislation throughout the United States. This
                  epoch-making act, the first of its kind in the world, represented the public
                  opinion of a colony of about 20,000 persons, living in thirty towns. It required
                  every town of fifty householders to establish a school, the master of which should
                  be paid either by the parents of the children taught or by public tax, as the
                  majority of the town committee might decide ; and it further required every town
                  of one hundred families or householders to set up a grammar school in which pupils
                  might be prepared for the <q>" University,"</q> as the new institution at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambridge,_Massachusetts">Cambridge</name> was designated. Moreover, a penalty was attached to neglect of
                  this legislative requirement, in the form of a fine to be devoted to the
                  maintenance of the nearest school. <ref>

                      adequately to conceive the boldness of the measure, which aimed at universal
                      education through the establishment of free schools. As a fact, it had no
                      precedent in the world's history ; and, as a theory, it could have been
                      refuted and silenced by a more formidable array of argument and experience
                      than was ever marshalled against any other institution of human origin. But
                      time has ratified its soundness. Two centuries of successful operation now
                      proclaim it to be as wise as it was courageous, and as beneficent as it was

                  almost uniformly dominant. The greater number of their students were preparing for
                  the ministry in some one of the branches of the Protestant Church. These facts
                  caused the grammar schools to take on more and more the character of
                  college-preparatory schools; and when this was brought about they supplied the
                  educational needs of but one portion of the community. As time passed, the
                  interdependence of governmental <pb n="985" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0985.png"/> and ecclesiastical interests
                  began to weaken in the colonies, and there arose among those who represented the
                  new secularizing tendency a distrust of the colleges and their influence. This
                  gave rise to a new and influential type of school, the academy, which took its
                  name from the secondary schools established in England by the dissenting religious
                  bodies during the latter part of the seventeenth century at the suggestion of
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Milton">Milton</name>.
                  These academies were intended to give an education which was thought to be more
                  practical than that offered by the colleges, and they drew their students from the
                  so-called middle classes of society. The older academies were usually endowed
                  institutions, organized under the control of religious organizations or of
                  self-perpetuating boards of trustees. Their programme of studies was less
                  restricted than that of the grammar schools, and they gave new emphasis to the
                  study of the English language and its literature, of mathematics and of the new
                  sciences of nature. For two generations the academies were a most beneficent
                  factor in American education, and they supplied a large number of the
                  better-prepared teachers for work in other schools. These schools were in a sense
                  public in that they were chartered, but they were not directly under public
                  control in their management. Early in the 19th century there arose a well-defined
                  demand for public secondary schools—high schools, as they are popularly known.
                  They were the direct outgrowth of the elementary school system. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston">Boston</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baltimore">Baltimore</name> and

                    York</name> were the first of the large cities to establish schools of this
                  type, and they spread rapidly. These public secondary schools met with opposition,
                  however, springing partly from the friends of the academies, and partly from those
                  who held that governmental agency should be restricted to the field of elementary
                  education. The legal questions raised were settled by a decision of the supreme
                  court of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan">Michigan</name>, which contained these words: <quote>" Neither in our state
                    policy, in our constitution, nor in our laws do we find the primary school
                    districts restricted in the branches of knowledge which their officers may cause
                    to be taught, or the grade of instruction that may be given, if their voters
                    consent, in regular form, to bear the expense and raise the taxes for the
                    purpose."</quote> This decision gave marked impetus to the development of public
                  secondary or high schools, and they have increased rapidly in number. The
                  academies have relatively declined, and in the Western states are almost
                  unknown.</p>
                                <p>Meanwhile the elementary school system had grown rapidly. The school district,
                  the smallest civil division, was created in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connecticut">Connecticut</name> in 1701, in
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhode_Island">Rhode
                    Island</name> about 1750, and in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> in 1789.
                  From the point of view of efficient, wellsupported schools, it has been felt since
                  the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace_Mann">Horace Mann</name> that the substitution of the small school district for the
                  town as the unit of school administration was a mistake. Yet the school district
                  has exercised a profound influence for good upon the American people. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York state</name>,
                  for example there were in 1900 over eleven thousand school districts, and in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illinois">Illinois</name> over
                  twelve thousand. The districts are small in extent and often sparsely settled.
                  Their government is as democratic as possible. The resident legal voters, often
                  including women, hold a meeting at least once a year. They elect trustees to
                  represent them in the employment of the teacher and the management of the school.
                  They determine whether a new schoolhouse shall be built, whether repairs shall be
                  made, and what sum of money shall be raised for school purposes. In the rural
                  districts this system has often been itself a school in patriotism and in the
                  conduct of public affairs. Recently the tendency is to merge the school districts
                  into the township, in order that larger and better schools may be maintained, and
                  that educational advantages may be distributed more evenly among the people. Most
                  of the southern states have the county system of school administration. This is
                  because the county, rather than the township, has been the political unit in the
                  south from the beginning. Special laws have been made for the school system in
                  cities, and the form of these laws differs very much. In nearly every city there
                  is a separate board of education, sometimes chosen by the voters, sometimes
                  appointed by the mayor or other official, which board has full control of the
                  schools. The city board of education has as its executive officer a superintendent
                  of schools, who has become a most important factor in American educational
                  administration. He exerts great influence in the selection of teachers, in the
                  choice of text-books, in the arrangement of the programme of studies, and in the
                  determination of questions of policy. Sometimes he is charged by law with the
                  initiative in some or all of these matters. He is usually a trained administrator
                  as well as an experienced teacher. The first superintendent was appointed in 1837

                  general, it may be said that the progress of public education in the United States
                  is marked by <list>
                                        <item>(1) compulsory schools,</item>
                                        <item>(2) compulsory licensing of teachers,</item>

                                    </list> and by the increasingly efficient administration of these provisions. The
                  compulsion comes in each case from the state government, which alone, in the
                  American system, has the power to prescribe it and to enforce it. Each state is
                  therefore an independent educational unit, and there is no single, uniform
                  American system of education in any legal sense. In fact, however, the great mass
                  of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_of_the_United_States">the American
                    people</name> are in entire agreement as to the principles which should control
                  public education; and the points in which the policies of the several states are
                  in agreement are greater, both in number and in importance, than those in which
                  they differ. An American educational system exists, therefore, in spirit and in
                  substance, even though not in form.</p>

                    the United States</title> is there any mention of education. The founders of the
                  nation were by no means indifferent to education, but they shared the common view
                  of their time, which was that the real responsibility for the maintenance of
                  schools and the expense of maintaining them should fall upon the several local
                  communities. The relation of government to education was not then a subject of
                  ordinary consideration or discussion. Later, when this question did arise and the
                  power of taxation was involved, the several states assumed control of education,
                  as it was necessary that they should do. Nevertheless, from the very beginning the
                  national government has aided and supported education, while not controlling it.
                  This policy dates from the 13th of July 1787, when there was passed the famous
                    <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northwest_Ordinance">" Ordinance for the

                                    <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northwest_Ordinance">The Ordinance of
                    1787</title> also reaffirmed the provisions of the so-called <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Land_Ordinance_of_1785">Land Ordinance of
                    1785</title>, by which section No. 16 in every township (a township consists of
                  36 numbered sections of 1 sq. m. each), or one thirty-sixth of the entire
                  north-west territory, was set aside for the maintenance of public schools within
                  the township. The funds derived from the sale and lease of these original <q>"
                    school lands "</q> form the major portion of the public school endowment of the
                  states formed out of the north-west territory. The precedent thus established
                  became the policy of the nation. Each state admitted prior to 1848 reserved
                  section No. 16 in every township of public land for common schools. Each state
                  admitted since 1848 (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Utah">Utah</name> being an exception, and having four sections) has reserved sections
                  No. 16 and No. 36 in every township of public lands for this purpose. In addition,
                  the national government has granted two townships in every state and territory
                  containing public lands for seminaries or universities. A third land grant is that
                  made in 1862 for colleges of agriculture and the mechanical arts. The sum total of
                  these three land grants amounted in <pb n="986" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0986.png"/> 1900 to 78,659,439 acres, to
                  which there must be added various special grants made from time to time to the
                  states and devoted to education. The portion of the public domain so set apart in
                  1900 amounted in all to 86,138,473 acres, or 134,591 English sq. m. This is an
                  area greater than those of the six <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_England">New England</name> states, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Jersey">New Jersey</name>,

                  and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delaware">Delaware</name>
                  added together. It is a portion of the earth's surface as great as the kingdom of
                  Prussia, about seven-tenths as great as France, and considerably greater than the
                  combined areas of Great Britain (including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Channel_Islands">the Channel Islands</name>)
                  and the kingdom of Holland. Besides the enormous grants of land in aid of
                  education, the national government has maintained since 1802 a <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Military_Academy">military

It has voted, by act of
                  1887, a perpetual endowment of $15,000 a year for each agricultural experiment
                  station connected with a state agricultural college, and, by act of 1890, an
                  additional endowment of $25,000 a year for each of the agricultural colleges
                  themselves. The aggregate value of land and money given by the national government
                  for education in the several states and territories is about $300,000,000.</p>

                  has therefore no direct power over the educational policy of the several states.
                  It has, however, exercised a potent influence for good in its advisory capacity.
                  Up to 1900 <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Bureau_of_Education">this
                    bureau</name> had published 360 separate volumes and pamphlets, including 31

                  been much increased. The annual reports alone of the Commissioner of Education are
                  mines of information. These standard works of reference are distributed

                                <p>In the United States the sovereign powers are not all lodged in one place. Such
                  of those powers as are not granted by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Constitution">the
                    Constitution</title> to the national government are reserved to the states
                  respectively, or to the people. The power to levy taxes for the support of public
                  education has been almost universally held to be one of the powers so reserved.
                  The inhabitants of the several local communities, however indisposed they may have
                  been to relinquish absolute control of their own schools, have been compelled to
                  yield to the authority of the state government whenever it has been asserted, for
                  except under such authority no civil division—county, city, township, or school
                  district—possesses the power to levy taxes for school purposes. Moreover, since
                  the exercise of state authority has uniformly improved the quality of the schools,
                  it has usually been welcomed, not resisted. In general, it may be said that the
                  state has used its authority to prescribe a minimum of efficiency which schools
                  and teachers must reach, and it enforces this minimum through inspection and the
                  withholding of its proper share of the state school fund from any locality where
                  schools or teachers are permitted to fall below the required standard. In extreme
                  cases the state authorities have interfered directly to prevent the evil results
                  of local inefficiency or contumacy. In addition, the states, almost without
                  exception, maintain at their own expense schools for the training of teachers,
                  known as normal schools. Many of the states also offer inducements to the cities,
                  towns and districts to exceed the prescribed minimum of efficiency. Through the
                  steady exercise of state supervision the school buildings have improved, the
                  standard for entrance upon the work of teaching has been raised, the programme of
                  studies has been made more effective and more uniform, and the length of the
                  school term has increased. The Constitution of every state now contains some
                  provision as to public education. Each state has an executive officer charged with
                  the enforcement of the state school laws. Sometimes, ab in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York</name>, this official has
                  plenary powers ; sometimes, as in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ohio">Ohio</name>, he is little
                  more than an adviser. In twenty-nine states this official is known as the
                  superintendent of public instruction ; in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connecticut">Connecticut</name> he
                  is called secretary of the state board of education ; other titles used are
                  commissioner of public schools, superintendent of common schools, and
                  superintendent of public schools. The schools are administered, on behalf of the
                  taxpayers, by an elected board of school trustees in rural school districts, and
                  by an elected (though sometimes appointed) board of education or school committee
                  in cities and towns. In 836 cities and towns there is a local superintendent of
                  schools, who directs and supervises the educational work and acts as the executive
                  officer of the board of education. The schools in the rural districts are under
                  the direct supervision of a county superintendent of schools or similar official,
                  who is often chosen by the people, but who sometimes is named by the state
                  authorities. The county and city superintendents are often charged with the duty
                  of holding examinations for entrance upon the work of teaching, and of issuing
                  licences to those persons who pass the examinations. This system works best where
                  it is carefully regulated by state law. Thirty states, one territory, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington,_D.C.">the District of
                    Columbia</name> have enacted compulsory education laws, but the enforcement of
                  them is usually very lax. In fifteen states and territories there are no
                  compulsory education laws, although there are in existence there fully organized
                  school systems free to all children. The usual age during which school attendance
                  is required is from 8 to 14.

                  manufacturing establishment are in force in twelve states, and are usually
                  administered in connexion with the compulsory education laws.</p>

                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._Louis,_Missouri">St
                    Louis</name>; and the so-called maternal stage, which from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago">Chicago</name> as a centre is
                  spreading over the entire country. During the first stage public attention was
                  directed to a few of the most important aspects of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Fröbel">Froebel</name>'s teaching.
                  During the second stage the kindergarten was valued largely as a reformatory and
                  redemptive influence. During the third stage the fundamental principles underlying
                  kindergarten training were scientifically studied and expounded, and the
                  kindergarten became part of the public school system of the country. The fourth
                  stage, which, like the third, is fortunately still in existence, aims at making
                  the kindergarten a link between the school and the home, and so to use it to
                  strengthen the foundations and elevate the ideals of family life. By 1898 there
                  were 4363 kindergartens in the United States (1365 of which were public),
                  employing 9937 teachers (2532 in the public kindergartens) and enrolling 189,604
                  children (95,867 in the public kindergartens). Of the 164 public normal schools,
                  36 made provision for training kindergarten teachers. The scientific and literary
                  activity of some of the private kindergarten training classes is very great, and
                  they exert a beneficial and stimulating effect on teaching in the elementary
                  schools. It is generally admitted that from the point of view of the children, of
                  the teachers, of the schools, and of the community at large, the kindergarten has
                  been and is an inspiration of incalculable value.</p>

                                <p>The elementary school course is from six to nine years in length, the ordinary
                  period being eight years. The pupils enter at about six years of age. In the
                  cities the elementary schools are usually in session for five hours daily, except
                  Saturday and Sunday, beginning at 9 A.M. There is an intermission, usually of an
                  hour, at midday, and short recesses during the sessions. In the small rural
                  schools the pupils are usually ungraded, and are taught singly or in varying
                  groups. In the cities and towns there is a careful gradation of pupils, and
                  promotions from grade to grade are made at intervals of a year or of a half-year.
                  The best schools have the most elastic system of gradation and the most frequent
                  promotions. In a number of states there are laws authorizing the conveyance of
                  children to school at the public expense, when the schoolhouse is unduly distant
                  from the homes of a portion of the school population. Co-education (q.v.) in the
                  elementary school has been the salutary and almost uniform practice in the United
                  States. The programme of studies in the elementary school includes English
                  (reading, writing, spelling, grammar, composition), arithmetic (sometimes
                  elementary algebra also, or plane geometry in the upper grades), geography,
                  history of the United States, and elementary natural science, including human
                  physiology and hygiene. Physical training, vocal music, drawing and manual
                  training are often taught. Sometimes a foreign language (Latin, German or French)
                  and the study of general history are begun. Formal instruction in manners and
                  morals is not often found, but the discipline of the school offers the best
                  possible training in the habits of truthfulness, honesty, obedience, regularity,
                  punctuality and conformity to order. Religious teaching is not permitted, although
                  the exercises of the day are often opened with reading from <title>the
                    Bible</title>, the repetition of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord's_Prayer">the Lord's Prayer</title> and
                  the singing of a hymn. Corporal punishment is not infrequent, but is forbidden by
                  law in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Jersey">New

                    recite "</q> in class to the teacher, who, by use of illustration and comment,
                  makes clear the subject-matter of the prescribed lesson. The purpose of the
                  recitation method is to make the work of each pupil help that of his companion.
                  Skilfully used, it is the most effectual instrument yet devised for elementary
                  school instruction.</p>

                                <p>The secondary school course is normally four years in length. The principal
                  subjects studied are Latin, Greek, French, German, algebra, geometry, physics,
                  chemistry, physical geography, physiology, rhetoric, English literature, civics
                  and history. Although but 11-36 % of the students in public high schools and 25-36
                  % of those in private secondary schools are preparing for a college or scientific
                  school, yet the conditions prescribed by the colleges for admission to their
                  courses affect powerfully both the secondary school programme and the methods of
                  teaching. Of late years no educational topic has been more widely discussed than
                  that as to the proper relations of secondary schools and colleges. As a result,
                  special examinations for admission to college are either greatly simplified or
                  entirely abolished, and the secondary studies are much more substantial and better
                  taught than formerly. An increasing proportion of secondary school teachers are
                  college graduates. The most extraordinary characteristic of secondary education in
                  recent years is the rapid increase in the number of students taking Latin as a
                  school subject. Meanwhile the proportion of those studying physics and chemistry
                  has fallen off slightly. The rate of increase in the number of pupils who study
                  Latin is fully twice as great as the rate of increase in the number of secondary
                  school students. Between 1890 and 1896, while the number of students in private
                  secondary schools increased 12 %, the number of students in public secondary
                  schools increased 87 %. Since 1894 the number of students in private secondary
                  schools has steadily declined.</p>

                                <p>The American college, although it is the outgrowth of the English colleges of
                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</name> and of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Cambridge">Cambridge</name>, has
                  developed into an institution which has no counterpart in Europe. The college
                  course of study, at first three years in length, was soon extended to four years,
                  and the classes are uniformly known as the freshman, the sophomore, the junior and
                  the senior. The traditional degree which crowns the college course is that of
                  Bachelor of Arts (A.B.). The studies ordinarily insisted on in the case of
                  candidates for this degree are Latin, Greek, mathematics, English, philosophy,
                  political economy, history, at least one modern European language (French or
                  German), and at least one natural science. The degrees of Bachelor of Science
                  (B.S.), Bachelor of Philosophy (Ph.B.), and Bachelor of Letters (B.L.) are often
                  conferred by colleges upon students who have pursued systematic courses of study
                  which do not include Greek or the amount of Latin required for the degree of
                  Bachelor of Arts. The best colleges give instruction which is similar in character
                  to that given in Germany in the three upper classes of the gymnasium and in the
                  introductory courses at the universities, in France in the two upper classes of
                  the <foreign xml:lang="fr">lycée</foreign> and in the first two years of
                  university study, and in England in the upper form of the public schools and
                  during the years of undergraduate residence at <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Cambridge">Cambridge</name>. Since 1870 the colleges have developed enormously. Their
                  resources have multiplied, the number of their students has increased by leaps and
                  bounds, the programme of studies has broadened and deepened, the standards have
                  been raised, and the efficiency of the instruction has greatly increased. Rigidly
                  prescribed courses of study have given way to elective courses, and a knowledge of
                  Greek is no longer required for the degree of A.B. at such influential colleges as
                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_College">Harvard</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbia_University">Columbia</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cornell_University">Cornell</name> and <name type="institution">Williams</name>
                                    <note type="uncertainty" resp="#gorobiy">It is not clear here whether “Williams”
                    refers to the Williams College (see
                    http://dbpedia.org/resource/Williams_College) or to the Roger Williams
                    University (see http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Williams_University). – Alexey
                    Gorobiy</note>. A strong effort is being made to have the leading colleges give
                  but one degree, that of Bachelor of Arts, and to confer that upon those who
                  complete any substantial course of college studies. A marked change has taken
                  place in the attitude of the college authorities toward the students. In 1870 the
                  college president was a paterfamilias. He knew each student and came into direct
                  personal contact with him. The president and the faculty had supervision not only
                  of the studies of the students, but of their moral and religious life as well. The
                  older type of college professor was not always a great scholar, but he was a
                  student of human nature, with keen intuitions and shrewd insight. The new type,
                  which had come into existence at the opening of the 20th century, was more
                  scholarly in some special direction, often regarded teaching as a check upon
                  opportunities for investigation, and disdained troubling himself with a student's
                  personal concerns or intellectual and moral difficulties. The change was not
                  altogether <pb n="988" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0988.png"/> for the
                  better, and a desirable reaction has been observable. Each college, however small
                  or ill-equipped, exercises a helpful local influence. Ninety per cent of all
                  college students attend an institution not more than one hundred miles from their
                  own homes. Few colleges have a national constituency, and even in these cases an
                  overwhelming preponderance of the students come from the immediate neighbourhood.
                  This explains, in a measure, the powerful influence which the college has
                  exercised in the life of the nation. While hardly more than one in a hundred of
                  the white male youth of the country has had a college education, yet the college
                  graduates have furnished one-half of all the presidents of the United States, most
                  of the justices of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">the Supreme
                    Court</name>, about one-half of the cabinet officers and United States senators,
                  and nearly one-third of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives">the
                    House of Representatives</name>. Before the Revolution eleven colleges were
                  founded. From 1776 to 1800, twelve more were added ; from 1800 to 1830,
                  thirty-three ; from 1830 to 1865, one hundred and eighty ; from 1865 to 1898, two
                  hundred and thirty-six. Their standards, efficiency and equipment are very
                  diverse, many of the so-called colleges being less effective than some of the
                  better organized secondary schools. Except in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</name>,

                  good secondary schools. Only time and a greatly increased capacity to distinguish
                  the various types of higher schools will remedy this error. Putting aside
                  tentative and unsuccessful attempts to develop genuine university instruction much
                  earlier, it may safely be said that the opening of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Hopkins_University">Johns Hopkins

                  Ph.D. is two years after obtaining the bachelor's degree; but in practice, three,
                  and even four, years of study are found necessary. In addition to carrying on an
                  investigation in the field of his main subject of study, the candidate for the
                  degree of Ph.D. is usually required to pass examinations on one or two subordinate
                  subjects, to possess a reading knowledge of French and German (often of Latin as
                  well), and to submit—usually in printed form—the dissertation which embodies the
                  results of his researches. The methods of instruction in the universities are the
                  lecture, discussion and work in laboratory or seminary—the latter transplanted
                  from the German universities. The degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon
                  students who, after one year of university residence and study, pass certain
                  prescribed examinations. This degree, like those of D.D., S.T.D. and L.L.D., is
                  often conferred by colleges and universities as a purely honorary distinction. The
                  degree of Ph.D. is not so conferred any longer by the best universities. Not a few
                  of the universities maintain schools of law and medicine. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_University">Harvard</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yale_University">Yale</name>
                  universities maintain schools of theology as well. The learned publications issued
                  by the universities, or under the direction of university professors, are of great
                  importance, and constitute an imposing body of scientific literature. The national
                  and state governments make increasing use of university officials for public
                  service requiring special training or expert knowledge. In 1871-1872 there were
                  only 198 resident graduate (or university) students in the United States. In 1887
                  this number had risen to 1237, and in 1897 to 4392. These figures are exclusive of
                  professional students, and include only those who are studying in what would be
                  called, in Germany, the philosophical faculty. (See also UNIVERSITIES.)</p>

                      L. Thorndike</name>, of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teachers_College,_Columbia_University">the
                      Teachers' College, Columbia University</name>, there summarizes the national
                    account as follows :— <quote>"We use in formal school education a material plant
                      valued at from twelve to thirteen hundred million dollars, the labour of
                      550,000 teachers or other educational officers, and more or less of the time
                      of some eighteen million students ... We pay for the labour of those teachers,
                      many of whom work for only part of the normal cityschool year, about
                      $300,000,000. We pay for fuel, light, janitorial services, repairs,
                      depreciation of books, school supplies, insurance and the like, about
                      $90,000,000. For depreciation of the plant not so charged we should properly
                      provide during the year a sinking fund of perhaps $25,000,000. Adding an
                      interest charge of 5 % on the investment in the plant, our annual bill for
                      formal school education comes to over $475.000,000. Additions to the plant
                      were made [in 1906-1907] to the extent of from ninety to a hundred million
                      dollars. As a partial estimate of the returns from this investment we may take
                      the number of students whose education has been carried to a specified
                      standard of accomplishment and power. Thus I estimate that, in 1907, 3000
                      students reached the standard denoted by three years or more of academic,
                      technical or professional study in advance of a reputable college degree ;
                      that 25,000 students reached the standard denoted by at least three and not
                      over four years of such study in advance of a four-year high-school course;
                      that an eighth of a million students reached the standard denoted by at least
                      three and not over four years of study in advance of an eight-year
                      elementary-school course; and that three-quarters of a million students
                      reached the standard of completion of an elementary school course of seven or
                      eight years or its equivalent ... Roughly, nine-tenths of elementary education
                      and the education of teachers, over two-thirds of secondary education, and
                      over a third of college and higher technical education are provided and
                      controlled by the public. Professional education, other than the training of
                      teachers and engineers, is still largely a function of private provision and
                      control. " The following rough comparison may serve to define further the
                      status of education in the country at large. The plant used for formal
                      education is valued at 1 % of our entire national wealth, or twice the value
                      of our telephone systems, or ten times the value of our Pullman and private
                      cars, or one-tenth the value of our railroads. The number of teachers is
                      approximately that of the clergymen, engineers, lawyers and physicians
                      together, five times that of the regular army and navy, and about twice that
                      of the saloon-keepers and bar-tenders and their assistants. The annual
                      expenditure for education, exclusive of additions to the plant, is somewhat
                      over twice the expenditure for the war and navy departments of the national
                      government. It is three and a half times the expenditure of the national
                      government in 1907 for pensions. It is about one and a fourth times the cost
                        (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New

                            <p>It has justly become a commonplace of geography to describe Europe as a mere
                peninsula of Asia, but while it is necessary to bear this in mind in some aspects of
                the geography of the continent, more particularly in relation to the climate, the
                individuality of the continent is established in the clearest manner by the course
                of history and the resultant distribution of population. The earliest mention of
                Europe is in the Homeric <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homeric_Hymns">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Hymn to Apollo</hi>
                                </title>, but there Europe is not the name of a continent, but is opposed to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peloponnese">the Peloponnesus</name>
                and the islands of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aegean_Sea">the Aegean</name>. The distinction between Europe and Asia is found, however, in
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeschylus">Aeschylus</name>
                in the 5th century B.C, but there seems to be little doubt that this opposition was
                learnt by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the
                  Greeks</name> from some Asiatic people. On Assyrian monuments the contrast between

                frequent, and these names were probably passed on by <name type="people">the
                  Phoenicians</name> to <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name>, and gave rise to the names of Asia and Europe. Where the names
                originated the geographical distinction was clearly marked by the intervention of
                the sea, and this intervention marked equally clearly the distinction between Europe
                and Libya (Africa). As the knowledge of the world extended, the difficulty, which
                still exists, of fixing the boundary between Europe and Asia where there is land
                connexion, caused uncertainty in the application of the two names, but never
                obscured the necessity for recognizing the distinction. Even in the 3rd century B.C.
                Europe was regarded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</name> as including
                all that was then known of northern Asia. But the character of the physical features
                and climate finally determined the fact that what we know as Europe came to be
                occupied by more or less populous countries in intimate relation with one another,
                but separated on the east by unpeopled or very sparsely peopled areas from the
                countries of Asia, and the boundary between the two continents has long been
                recognized as running somewhere through this area. Within the limits thus marked out
                on the east and on other sides by the sea <quote>" the climatic conditions are such
                  that inhabitants are capable of and require a civilization of essentially the same
                  type, based upon the cultivation of our European grains."</quote>

                the south-east, others take the line of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kuma-Manych_Depression">the Manych

                nearly parallel to the Caucasus. Various limits are assigned to the continent on the

                                </title>. In favour of this limit it appears that much weight ought to be given to
                the consideration put forward by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermann_Wagner_(geographer)">Wagner</name>, that
                from time immemorial the valleys on both sides of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caucasus">the Caucasus</name> have formed a
                refuge for Asiatic peoples, especially when it is borne in mind that this contention
                is reinforced by the circumstance that the steppes to the north of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caucasus">the Caucasus</name> must
                interpose a belt of almost unpeopled territory between the more condensed
                populations belonging undoubtedly to Asia and Europe respectively. Continuity of
                population would be an argument in favour of assigning the whole of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ural_Mountains">the Urals</name> to
                Europe, but here the absence of any break in such continuity on the east side makes
                it more difficult to fix any boundary line outside of that system. Hence on this
                side it is perhaps reasonable to attach greater importance to the fact that <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ural_Mountains">the Urals</name>
                form a boundary not only orographically, but to some extent also in respect of

                            <p>Two of the most striking features in the general conformation of Europe are the
                great number of its primary and secondary peninsulas, and the consequent exceptional
                development of its coast-line—an irregularity and development which have been one of
                the most potent of the physical factors of its history. The total length of
                coast-line was estimated by <name type="person">Reuschle</name> in 1869 at 19,820
                m., of which about 3600 were counted as belonging to the Arctic Ocean, 8390 to the
                Atlantic, and 7830 to the Black Sea and Mediterranean. This estimate, however, does
                not take into account minor indentations. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Élisée_Reclus">Reclus</name>'s estimate,
                including the more important indentations, brings the coast-line up to 26,700 m.,
                and that of <name type="person">Strelbitsky</name> up to 47,790 m. (smaller islands
                not included), or 1 m. of coast for about 75 sq. m. of area. <name type="person">Rohrbach</name>

                the case of North America, the continent which ranks next in this respect. It must
                be pointed out, however, that such calculations are apt to be very misleading,
                inasmuch as the commercial value of the relations thus determined depends not merely
                on the existence of natural harbours or the presence of facilities for the
                construction of artificial harbours, but also on the presence of natural facilities
                for communication between such harbours and a productive interior.</p>

                            <p>The consideration just mentioned gives great significance to the fact that while
                the coast-line of Europe is in its general features very much the same as it was at
                the beginning of the true historic period, it has undergone a number of important
                local changes, some at least of which are due to causes that are at work over very
                extensive areas. These changes may be conveniently classified under four heads: the
                formation of deltas by the alluvium of rivers; the increase of the land-surface due
                to upheaval; the advance of the sea by reason of its own erosive activity; and the
                advance of the sea through the subsidence of the land. The actual form of the coast,
                however, is frequently due to the simultaneous or successive action of several of
                the causes—sea and river and subterranean forces helping or resisting each other.
                That changes in the coast-line on the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia have taken place
                within historical times through elevation of the land seems now to be generally
                admitted. The commune of Hvittisbofjärd north of Björneborg on the Finland side of
                that gulf gained about 2 1/4 sq. m. between 1784 and 1894, an amount greater than
                could be accounted for by the most liberal estimates of alluvial deposit, and the
                most careful investigation seems to show that on the Swedish coast of that gulf a
                rise has taken place in recent years on the east coast of Sweden from about 57° 20'
                N. increasing in amount towards the north up to 62º 20' N., where it reaches an
                average of about two-fifths of an inch annually. <note>See <bibl>

                Our information is naturally most complete in regard to the Mediterranean coasts, as
                these were the best known to the first book-writing nations. There we find that all
                the great rivers have been successfully at work—more especially the Rhone, the Ebro
                and the Po. The activity of the Rhone, indeed, as a maker of new land, is
                astonishing. The tower of St Louis, erected on the coast in 1737, is now upwards of
                four miles inland; the city of Arles is said to be nearly twice as far from the sea
                as it was in the Roman period. The present St Gilles was probably a harbour when the
                Greeks founded Marseilles, and Aigues Mortes, which took its place in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
                ages</name>, was no longer on the coast in the time of St Louis (13th century), but
                Narbonne continued to be a seaport till the 14th century. At the mouth of the
                Hérault, according to <ref>
                                    <name type="person">Fischer</name>,<note>" Küstenveränderungen im

                                </ref> the coast advances at least two metres or about 7 ft. annually ; and it
                requires great labour to keep the harbour of Cette from being silted up. The Po is
                even more efficient than the Rhone, if the size of its basin be taken into account.
                Ravenna, which was at one time an insular city like Venice, has now a wide stretch
                of downs partly covered with pine forest between it and the sea. Aquileia, one of
                the greatest seaports of the Mediterranean in the early centuries of the Christian
                era, is now 7 m. from the coast, and Adria, which gives its name to the sea, is 13.
                The islands on which Venice is built have sunk about 3 ft. since the 16th century:
                the pavement of the square of St Mark's has frequently required to be raised, and
                the boring of a well has shown that a layer of vegetable remains, indicating a flora
                identical with that observed at present on the neighbouring mainland, exists at a
                depth of 400 ft. below the alluvial deposits. A little to the south of Rovigno on
                the Istrian coast on the opposite side of the Adriatic a diver found at the depth of
                about 85 ft. the remains of a town, which has been identified with the island town
                of Cissa, of which nothing had been known after the year 679.<note>See <bibl>

                are found below the sea-level, and the district at the mouth of the Narenta has been
                changed into a swamp by the advance of the sea. A process of elevation, on the other

                Sardinia, the east of Corsica, and perhaps in the neighbourhood of Nice, while the
                west coast of Italy from the latitude of Rome to the southern shores of the Gulf of
                Salerno has undergone considerable oscillations of level within historical times.
                About the time of the settlement of the Greeks the coast stood at least 20 ft. above
                the level of the present day. Depression began in Roman times though then the land
                was still 16 ft. higher than now. A more rapid depression began in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
                ages</name>, so that the sea-level rose from 18 to 20 ft. above the present zero,
                and the coast began gradually to rise again at the close of the 15th
                  century.<note>See <bibl>

                Balkan peninsula, we find considerable changes on the coastline of Greece; but as
                they are only repetitions on a smaller scale of the phenomena already described, it
                is sufficient to indicate the Gulf of Arta and the mouth of the Spercheios as two of
                the more important localities. The latter especially is interesting to the historian
                as well as to the geologist, as the river has greatly altered the physical features
                of one of the world's most famous scenes—the battlefield of Thermopylae.</p>
                            <p>If we proceed to the Atlantic seaboard we observe, as we might expect, great
                modifications in the embouchures of the Garonne and the Loire, but by far the most
                remarkable variations of sea and land have taken place in the region extending from
                the south of Belgium in the neighbourhood of the Straits of Dover to the mouth of
                the Elbe and the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein. Here there has been a prolonged
                struggle between man and nature, in which on the whole nature has hitherto had the
                best of the battle. While, as is well known, much land below sea-level in the Low
                Countries has been protected against the sea by dikes and reclaimed, and the
                coast-line has been, on the whole, advanced between the Elbe and the Eider,<note>See <bibl>

                the interior of Holland since the beginning of the Christian era, and on the balance
                a large loss of land north of the Eider since the first half of the 13th century. <note>

                                </note> In the 1st century A.D. the Zuider Zee appears to have been represented only
                by a comparatively small inland lake, the dimensions of which were increased by
                different inroads of the sea, the last and greatest of which occurred in 1395. Among
                the local changes of European significance within this area may be mentioned the
                silting up towards the end of the 15th century of the channel known as the Zwin
                running north-eastwards from Bruges, which through that cause lost its shipping and
                in the end all its former renown as a seat of commerce.</p>
                            <p>The Baltic shores of Germany display the same phenomena of local gain and loss. In
                the western section inroads of the sea have been extensive: the island of Rügen
                would no longer serve for the disembarkation of an army like that of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gustavus_Adolphus_of_Sweden">Gustavus Adolphus</name> ; Wollin and Usedom are growing gradually less; large
                stretches of the mainland are fringed with submerged forests ; and at intervals the
                sites of well-known villages are occupied by the sea. Towards the east the great
                rivers are successfully working in the opposite direction. In the Gulf of Danzig the
                alluvial deposits of the Vistula cover an area of 615 sq. m . ; in the 13th century
                the knights of Marienburg enclosed with dikes about 350 sq. m.: and an area of about
                70 sq. m. was added in the course of the 14th. The Memel is silting up the Kurisches
                Haff, which, like the Frisches Haff is separated from the open sea by a line of
                dunes comparable with those of the Landes in France. The so-called strand or
                coast-lines at various altitudes round the Scandinavian peninsula, though belonging
                for the most part to glacial times, speak also of relative changes of level in the
                post-glacial period.</p>

                been familiarly known from the earliest historic times; but the fourth has only
                attracted particular attention since the 18th century. It lies m the Archipelago, on
                the southern edge of the Cyclades, near the little group of islets called Santonn.
                The region was evidently highly volcanic at an earlier period, for Milo, one of the
                nearest of the islands, is simply a ruined crater still presenting smoking
                solfataras and other traces of former activity. The devastations produced by the
                eruptions of the European volcanoes are usually confined within very narrow limits;
                and it is only at long intervals that any part of the continent is visited by a
                really formidable earthquake. The only part of Europe, however, for which there are
                no recorded earthquakes is central and northern Russia; and the Alps and
                Carpathians, especially the intra-Carpathian area of depression, Greece, Italy,
                especially Calabria and the adjoining part of Sicily, the Sierra Nevada and the
                Pyrenees, the Lisbon district and the rift valley of the upper Rhine (between the
                Vosges and the Black Forest) are all regions specially liable to earthquake shocks
                and occasionally to shocks of considerable intensity. One well-marked seismic line
                extends along the south side of the Alps from Lake Garda by Udine and Gorz to Fiume,
                and another forms a curve convex towards the south-east passing first through
                Calabria, then through the north-east of Sicily to the south of the Peloritan
                  Mountains.<note>See <bibl>

                European earthquakes in modern times, the most destructive are that of Lisbon in
                1755, and that of Calabria in 1783; the devastation produced by the former has
                become a classical instance of such disasters in popular literature, and by the
                latter 100,000 people are said to have lost their lives. Calabria again suffered
                severely in 1865, 1870, 1894, 1905 and 1908.</p>

                combined with the form of the coast-line which has indirectly given to Europe its
                individuality. Three points have to be noted under this head:-<list>
                                    <item>(1) the fact that the higlands of Europe are so distributed as to allow of

                                    <item>(2) the fact that the principal series of highlands has a direction from
                    east to west, Europe in this point resembling Asia but differing from North
                    America;</item>

                    crossing in proportion to their average altitude</item>
                                </list>. The first and second of these points have special importance with reference
                to the climate and will accordingly be considered more fully under that head. The
                second is also of importance with reference to the means of communication, to which
                the third also refers, and detailed consideration of these points in that relation
                will be reserved for that heading. Here, however, it may be noted that in Europe the
                distribution of the natural resources for the maintenance of the inhabitants is such
                that, if we leave out of account Russia, which is almost entirely outside of the
                series of highlands running east and west, the population north of the mountains is
                roughly about 50 % greater than that south of the mountains, whereas in Asia the
                population north of the east and west highland barrier is utterly insignificant as
                compared with that to the south.</p>
                            <p>From the table given on p. 909 (col. 1) it will be seen that the most extensive of
                the highland areas of Europe is that of Scandinavia, which has a general trend from
                south-south-west to north-north-east, and is completely detached by seas and plains
                from the highland area to the south. There are other completely detached highland
                areas in Iceland, the British Isles, the Ural Mountains, the small Yaila range in
                the south of the Crimea, and the Mediterranean islands. The connected series of
                highlands is that which extends from the Iberian peninsula to the Black Sea
                stretching in the middle of Germany northwards to about 52° N. In the Iberian
                peninsula we have the most marked example of the tableland form in Europe, and these
                tablelands are bounded on the north by the Cantabrian Mountains, which descend to
                the sea, and the Pyrenees, which, except at their extremities, cut off the Iberian
                peninsula from the adjoining country more extensively than any other chain in the
                continent. Between the foot-hills of the Pyrenees, however, and those of the central
                plateau of France the ground sinks in the Passage of Naurouse or Gap of Carcassonne
                to a well-marked gap establishing easy communication between the valley of the
                Garonne and the lower part of that of the Rhone. The highlands in the north spread
                northwards and then north-castwards till they join the Vosges, but sink in elevation
                towards the north-east so as to allow of several easy crossings. East of the Vosges
                the Rhine valley forms an important trough running north and south through the
                highlands of western Germany. To the south of the Vosges again undulating country of
                less than 1500 ft. in elevation, the well-known Burgundy Gate or Gap of Belfort,
                constitutes a well-marked break between those mountains and the Jura, and
                establishes easy communication between the Rhine and the Saône-Rhone valleys. The
                latter valley divides in the clearest manner the highlands of central France from
                both the Alps and the Jura, while between these last two systems there lies the
                wedge of the Swiss midlands contracting southwestwards to a narrow but important gap
                at the outlet of the Lake of Geneva. Between the Alps and the mountains of the
                Italian and Balkan peninsulas the orographical lines of demarcation are less
                distinct, but on the north the valley of the Danube mostly forms a wide separation
                between the Alps and the mountains of the Balkan peninsula on the south and the
                highlands of Bohemia and Moravia, the Carpathians and the Transylvanian Alps on the
                north. The valleys of the Eger and the Elbe form distinct breaks in the environment
                of Bohemia, and the Sudetes on the north-east of Bohemia and Moravia are even more
                clearly divided from the Carpathians by the valley of the upper Oder, the Moravian
                Gate, as it is called, which forms the natural line of communication between the
                south-east of Prussia and Vienna.</p>

                                </note> He finds that the dominant factor in determining that temperature is the
                temperature of the air above, but that rivers are divisible into four groups with
                respect to the relation between these temperatures at different seasons of the year.
                These groups are rivers flowing from glaciers, in which the temperature is warmer
                than the air in winter, colder in summer; rivers flowing from lakes, characterized
                by peculiarly high winter temperatures, in consequence of which the mean temperature
                for the year is always above that of the air ; rivers flowing from springs, which,
                at least near their source, are more rapidly cooled by low than warmed by high air
                temperatures; and rivers of the plains, which have a higher mean temperature than
                the air in all months of the year.</p>
                            <p>In various parts of Europe, more particularly in calcareous regions, such as the
                Jura, the Causses in the south-east of France, and the Karst in the north-west of
                the Balkan peninsula, there are numerous subterranean or partly subterranean rivers.
                Several of the more important rivers are of very irregular flow, and some are
                subject to really formidable floods. This is particularly the case with rivers a
                large part of whose basin is made up of crystalline or other impervious rocks with
                steep slopes, like those of the Loire in France and the Ebro in Spain. The Danube
                and its tributaries, the great rivers of Germany, above all eastern Germany, and
                those of Italy, are also <table rows="41" cols="6">

                            <p>The Alpine lakes break up into a southern and northern subdivision— the former
                consisting of the Lago Maggiore, and the lakes of Lugano and Como, Lago d'Iseo, and
                Lago di Garda, all connected by affluents with the system of the Po; and the latter
                the Lake of Geneva threaded by the Rhone, Lakes Constance, Zürich, Neuchâtel, Biel
                and other Swiss lakes belonging to the basin of the Rhine, and a few of minor
                importance belonging to the Danube. The north Russian lakes, Ladoga, Onega, etc, are
                mainly noticeable as the largest members of what in some respects is the most
                remarkable system of lakes in the continent—the Finno-Russian, which consists of an
                almost countless number of comparatively small irregular basins formed in the
                surface of a granitic plateau. In Finland proper they occupy no less than a twelfth
                of the total area.</p>
                            <p>A few of the number are very shallow. The Neusiedler See, for example (the Peiso
                Lacus of the Latins and Ferto-tava of the Hungarians), completely dried up in 1693,
                1738 and 1864, and left its bed covered for the most part with a deposit of
                  salt.<note>See <bibl>

                the extent of marsh land in Europe. The Minsk marshes in Russia form the largest
                area of this character still left, and on these large encroachments are gradually
                being made. Extensive marshes in northern Italy have been completely drained. The

                of the formation and destruction of successive mountain chains. Four times a great
                mountain range has been raised across the area which now is Europe. Three times the
                mountain range has given way; portions have sunk beneath the sea, and have been
                covered by more recent sediments, while other portions remained standing and now
                rise as isolated blocks above the later beds which surround them. The last of the
                mountain ranges still stands, and is known under the names of the Alps, the
                Carpathians, the Balkans, the Caucasus, etc, but the work of destruction has already
                begun, and gaps have been formed by the collapse of parts of the chain. The
                Carpathians were once continuous with the Alps, and the Caucasus was probably
                connected with the Balkans across the site of the Black Sea.</p>
                            <p>These mountain chains were not raised by direct uplift. They consist of crumpled
                and folded strata, and are, in fact, wrinkles in the earth's outer crust, formed by
                lateral compression, like the puckers which appear in a tablecloth when we push it
                forward against a book or other heavy object lying upon it. How the lateral or
                tangential pressures originated is still matter of controversy, but the usually
                accepted explanation is as follows. The interior of the earth in cooling contracts
                more rapidly than the exterior, and, if no other change took place, the outer crust
                would be left as a hollow sphere without any internal support. But the materials of
                which it is composed are not strong enough to bear its enormous weight, and, like an
                arch which is too weak in its abutments, it collapses upon the interior core. Where
                the crust is rigid it fractures, as an ordinary arch would fracture ; and some
                portions fall inward, while other parts may even be wedged a little outward. Where,
                on the other hand, the crust is made of softer rock, it crumples and folds, and a
                mountain chain is produced. Such a mountain chain, for want of a better term, is
                called a folded mountain chain. The folding is most intense where a flexible portion
                of the crust lies next to a more rigid part. Where the folding has occurred, the
                rocks which were once comparatively soft become hard and rigid, and the next series
                of wrinkles will usually be formed beyond the limits of the old one. This is what
                has happened in the European area.</p>
                            <p>The oldest mountain chain lay in the extreme north-west of Europe, and its relics
                are seen in the outer Hebrides, the Lofoten Islands and the north of Norway. The
                rocks of this ancient chain have since been converted into gneiss, and they were
                folded and denuded before the deposition of the oldest known fossiliferous
                sediments. The mountain system must therefore have been formed in Pre-Cambrian
                times, and it has been called by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcel_Alexandre_Bertrand">Marcel Bertrand</name>
                the Huronian chain. It is probable that a great land-mass lay towards the
                north-west; but in the sea which certainly existed south-east of the chain, the
                Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian beds were deposited. In Russia and South Sweden
                these beds still lie flat and undisturbed; but in Norway, Scotland, the Lake
                District, North Wales and the north of Ireland they were crushed against the
                north-western continent and were not only intensely folded but were pushed forward
                over the old rocks of the Huronian chain. Thus was formed the Caledonian mountain
                system of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Ed.
                  Suess</name>, in which the folds run from south-west to north-east. It was raised
                at the close of the Silurian period.</p>
                            <p>Then followed, in northern Europe, a continental period. By the elevation of the
                Caledonian chain the northern land-mass had grown southward and now extended as far
                as the Bristol Channel. Upon it the Old Red Sandstone was laid down in inland seas
                or lakes, while farther south contemporaneous deposits were formed in tho open
                sea.</p>
                            <p>During the earlier part of the Carboniferous period the sea spread over the
                southern shores of the northern continent; but later the whole area again became
                land and the Coal Measures of northern Europe were laid down. Towards the close of
                the Carboniferous period the third great mountain chain was formed. It lay to the
                south of the Caledonian chain, and its northern margin stretched from the south of
                Ireland through South Wales, the north of France and the south of Belgium, and was
                continued round the Harz and the ancient rocks of Bohemia, and possibly into the
                south of Russia. It is along this northern margin, where the folded beds have been
                thrust over the rocks which lay to the north, that the coalfields of Dover and of
                Belgium occur. The general direction of the folds is approximately from west to
                east; but the chain consisted of two arcs, the western of which is called by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name> the
                Armorican chain and the eastern the Variscian. The two arcs together, which were
                undoubtedly formed at the same period, have been named by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcel_Alexandre_Bertrand">Bertrand</name> the
                Hercynian chain. Everywhere the chief folding seems to have occurred before the
                deposition of the highest beds of the Upper Carboniferous, which lie unconformably
                upon the folded older beds. The Hercynian chain appears to have been of considerable
                breadth, at least in western Europe, for the Palaeozoic rocks of Spain and Portugal
                are thrown into folds which have the same general direction and which were formed at
                approximately the same period. In eastern Europe the evidence is less complete,
                because the Hercynian folds are buried beneath more recent deposits and have in some
                cases been masked by the superposition of a later series of folds.</p>
                            <p>The formation of this Carboniferous range was followed in northern Europe by a
                second continental period somewhat similar to that of the Old Red Sandstone, but the
                continent extended still farther to the south. The Permian and Triassic deposits of
                England and Germany were laid down in inland seas or upon the surface of the land
                itself. But southern Europe was covered by the open sea, and here, accordingly, the
                contemporaneous deposits were marine.</p>
                            <p>The Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were free from any violent folding or mountain
                building, and the sea again spread over a large part of the northern continent.
                There were indeed several oscillations, but in general the greater part of southern
                and central Europe lay beneath the waters of the ocean. Some of the fragments of the
                Hercynian chain still rose as islands above the waves, and at certain periods there
                seems to have been a more or less complete barrier between the waters which covered
                northern Europe and those which lay over the Mediterranean region. Thus, while the
                estuarine deposits of the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous were laid down in
                England and Germany, the purely marine Tithonian formation, with its peculiar fauna,
                was deposited in the south ; and while the Chalk was formed in northern Europe, the
                Hippurite limestone was laid down in the south.</p>
                            <p>The Tertiary period saw fundamental changes in the geography of Europe. The
                formation of the great mountain ranges of the south, the Alpine system of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name>, perhaps
                began at an earlier date, but it was in the Eocene and Miocene periods that the
                chief part of the elevation took place. Arms of the sea extended up the valley of
                the Rhone and around the northern margin of the Alps, and also spread over the
                plains of Hungary and of southern Russia. Towards the middle of the Miocene period
                some of these arms were completely cut off from the ocean and large deposits of salt
                were formed, as at Wieliczka. At a later period south-eastern Europe was covered by
                a series of extensive lagoons, and the waters of these lagoons gradually became
                brackish, and then fresh, before the area was finally converted into dry land. Great
                changes also took place in the Mediterranean region. The Black Sea, the Aegean, the
                Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian Sea were all formed at various times during the Tertiary
                period, and the depression of these areas seems to be closely connected with the
                elevation of the neighbouring mountain chains.</p>
                            <p>Exactly what was happening in northern Europe during these great changes in the
                south it is not easy to say. The basaltic flows of the north of Ireland, the western
                islands of Scotland, the Faeroe Islands and Iceland are mere fragments of former
                extensive plateaus. No sign of marine Tertiary deposits of earlier age than Pliocene
                has been found in this northern part of Europe, and on the other hand plant remains
                are abundant in the sands and clays interbedded with the basalts. It is probable,
                therefore, that in Eocene times a great land-mass lay to the north-west of Europe,
                over which the basalt lavas flowed, and that the formation of this part of the
                Atlantic and perhaps of the North Sea did not take place until the Miocene
                period.</p>
                            <p>At a later date the climate, for some reason which has not yet been fully
                explained, grew colder over the whole of Europe, and the northern part was covered
                by a great ice-sheet which extended southward nearly as far as lat. 50º N., and has
                left its marks over the <pb n="912" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0912.png"/>
                whole of the northern part of the continent. With the final melting and
                disappearance of the ice-sheet, the topography of Europe assumed nearly its present
                form, and man came upon the scene. Minor changes, such as the separation of Great
                Britain from the continent, may have occurred at a later date ; but since the
                Glacial period there have, apparently, been no fundamental modifications in the
                configuration of Europe.</p>
                            <p>The elevation of each of the great mountain systems already described was
                accompanied by extensive eruptions of volcanic rocks, and the sequence appears to
                have been similar in every case. The volcanoes of the Mediterranean are the last
                survivors of the great eruptions which accompanied the elevation of the Alpine
                mountain system.</p>

                distinguished for its warmth and dryness ; the Rotenturm wind of Transylvania, which
                has similar characteristics ; the bora of the Upper Adriatic, so noticeable for its
                violence ; the mistral of southern France ; the etesian winds of the Mediterranean ;
                and the sirocco, which proves so destructive to the southern vegetation. Though it
                is only at comparatively rare intervals that the winds attain the development of a
                hurricane, the destruction of life and property which they occasion, both by sea and
                land, is in the aggregate of no small moment. About six or seven storms from the
                west pass over the continent every winter, usually appearing later in the southern
                districts, such as Switzerland or the Adriatic, than in the northern districts, as
                Scotland and Denmark.</p>

                            <p>The great determining factors of the climate of Europe are these. The northern
                borders of the continent are within the Arctic Circle ; the most southern points of
                the mainland are 13 1/2° or more north of the Tropic of Cancer ; to the east extends
                for about 3000 m. the continuous land surface of Asia ; to the west lie the waters
                of the north Atlantic, which penetrate in great inland seas to the north and south
                of the great European peninsula ; the prevailing winds in western Europe as already
                stated are more or less south-westerly ; and the arrangement of the highlands is
                such as to allow of the penetration of winds with a westerly element in their
                direction far to the east. The first two of these factors are not distinguishing
                influences. They affect the climate of Europe in the same manner as they do that of
                any other land surface in the same latitudes.</p>
                            <p>The remaining factors, however, are of the highest importance. It is to them in
                fact that Europe owes in a very large measure those physical conditions which are
                the basis of its recognition as a separate continent. In estimating the value of
                those factors one must bear in mind, first, that the waters of the north Atlantic
                are exceptionally warm, especially on the European side of the ocean. The Gulf
                Stream carries a large body of warm water northwards to near the parallel of 40º N.,
                and to the north of the Gulf Stream prevailing south-westerly winds, especially
                during the winter months, drift onwards to the western and northern shores of
                Europe, even as far east as Spitsbergen, large bodies of water of an exceptionally
                high temperature. Secondly, one must bear in mind that these relatively high
                temperatures over the ocean promote evaporation and thus favour the presence of a
                relatively large amount of water-vapour in the air over those parts of the ocean
                which adjoin the continent; and, thirdly, that, as the winds are the sole means of
                carrying water-vapour from one part of the earth's surface to the other, and the
                sole means of carrying heat and cold from the ocean to the land, the prevailing
                south-westerly winds are allowed by the superficial configuration to bring a
                relatively high rainfall and a relatively large amount of heat in winter to land
                farther in the interior than in any corresponding latitudes. During the summer the
                winds referred to have a cooling effect, but not to the same degree as those of
                winter tend to raise the temperature. From the point of view just indicated the only
                part of the world that is fairly comparable with Europe is the west of North America
                ; but, as there the outline and superficial configuration are quite different, the
                oceanic influences affect only a narrow strip of seaboard and not any extent of land
                which could be regarded as of continental rank. It is owing to these influences that
                in the greater part of Europe there is a more or less continuous population
                dependent on agriculture. On the east side of Europe, again, the existence of the
                continent of Asia has a marked effect on the climate which also aids in giving to
                Europe its individual character. It is owing to that circumstance that the
                south-east of the continent, which has temperatures as favourable to agriculture as
                the corresponding latitudes of eastern Asia or eastern North America, is without the
                copious rains which make those temperatures so valuable, and hence forms part of the
                desert that divides the populations of Europe and Asia.</p>

                            <p>On the local distribution of rainfall and temperature, the physical configuration
                of the continent has very marked effects. Here as elsewhere there is a striking
                difference both in the amount of rainfall and the temperature on the weather and lee
                sides of mountains and even low hills. But with reference to this it should not be
                forgotten that water-vapour, heat and cold may be carried farther into the land by
                winds blowing in a different direction from that of those by which they were
                introduced from the ocean, and, with reference to rainfall, that the condensation of
                water-vapour may be brought out by different winds from those by which the
                water-vapour was brought to the area in which it is condensed. Water-vapour that may
                have been introduced by a south-westerly wind may be driven against a mountain side
                by a northerly or easterly wind, and thus cause rain on the northern or eastern side
                of the mountain. Still, any rainfall map of Europe indicates clearly enough the
                origin of the water-vapour to which the rainfall is due. Such a map, taking into
                account the results of more detailed investigations of different parts of the

                intervals of 250 mm. (about 10 in.) up to 1000 mm., and beyond that at intervals of
                500 mm. up to 2000 mm. In some parts of the continent the limits of a rainfall of
                200 mm. and 600 mm. are also shown. The picture there given is too complicated for
                brief description except by saying quite generally that it shows on the whole a
                diminution in the total amount of precipitation from west to east, and that the
                heaviest precipitation is indicated on the west or south and most exposed sides of
                mountains. The areas of scantiest rainfall lie to the north and north-west of the
                Caspian Sea and in the interior of the Kola Peninsula, northwest of the White Sea.
                The Stye in the English Lake District, some 2 m. from and 650 ft. higher than
                Seathwaite, has long been reputed to be the station recording the heaviest rainfall
                in Europe, but it has been shown to have a rival in Crkvice, a station immediately
                to the north of the Bocche di Cattaro on the Dalmatian coast. In the period
                1881-1890 the average rainfall at the Stye amounted to 177 in., in 1891-1900 that at
                Crkvice amounted to about 179 in. <note>See a paper on <bibl>

                now coming to be recognized as an important climatological element. So far, however,
                the only European country in which a record of the snowfall is kept is Russia, but
                it may be pointed out that the scantiness of the winter precipitation and
                accordingly of snow in the south-east of Europe almost entirely prevents the
                cultivation of winter wheat, which is thus left without the protective blanket
                enjoyed in some other parts of the world with cold winters.</p>

                  thirty years 1861- 1890 are recorded and discussed. The first paper
                    (<date>1893</date>, B, pp. 157-194) deals with the Iberian Peninsula, the second
                    (<date>1895</date>, B, pp. 155-192) with western Europe (from about 43º to 58º

                maps showing by six tints the mean rainfall for each month as well as for the entire
                year; and that on western Europe, by maps extending in the west as far south as
                Avila, the proportion of the rainfall occurring during the winter, spring, autumn
                and summer months respectively. But the most instructive maps on the subject

                in spring, summer, autumn and winter respectively. From the maps it appears that all
                the southern and western coasts of Europe have a high proportion of rain in autumn,
                and that this is true also of the whole of the Italian peninsula and the islands of
                the western half of the Mediterranean, of all the south-west of the Balkan
                peninsula, including the Peloponnesus, of the Saône-Rhone valley and both sides of
                the Gulf of Bothnia, and that a high winter rainfall is characteristic of Iceland,
                the extreme western coasts of Scotland, Ireland, France and the Iberian peninsula,
                as well as of the greater part of the Mediterranean region, but more particularly
                the south-east, while in this region, and, again more particularly in the
                south-east, there is a great scarcity of summer rains, which, on the other hand,
                form the highest percentage in the interior and eastern parts of the continent. If
                the year be divided into a winter and summer half, the area with a predominance of
                summer rains begins in the east of Great Britain <pb n="913" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0913.png"/> and extends eastwards, while the
                Mediterranean region generally is one of rainy winters and relatively dry summers.
                The consequence is that with similar conditions of soil and superficial
                configuration the Mediterranean region is agriculturally much less productive,
                except where there are means of irrigation, than the corresponding latitudes in the
                east of Asia and the east of North America, where there are corresponding summer
                temperatures but an opposite seasonal distribution of rainfall.</p>

                                    <name type="person">Dr Supan</name> in an interesting series of maps based on
                  actual observations not reduced to sea-level, and showing the duration in months
                  of the periods within which the mean daily temperature lies within certain ranges
                  (at or below 32º F.; 5O°-68º F.; above 68° F).<note>

                                            <hi rend="italic">Ib.</hi>

                                </ref> The first of these maps strikingly illustrates the effect on temperature of
                the strong westerly winds of winter, and, in the south, that of winds from the
                Mediterranean Sea as well as the protection afforded to the Mediterranean countries
                against cold winds from the north by the barrier of mountains. South of the parallel
                of 60° there is no lowland area in the west of Europe where the average daily
                temperature is at or below the freezing point for as much as one month, and in the
                Mediterranean region only the higher parts of the mountains besides the northern
                part of the Balkan Peninsula are characterized by such prolonged frosts. On the
                other hand, on the parallel of 50º N. the duration of such low temperatures
                increases at first rapidly, afterwards more gradually, from west to east. The second
                map illustrating the duration of average daily temperatures between 50º and 68° F.,
                that is, the temperatures favourable to the ordinary vegetation of the temperate
                zone, shows that the duration of such temperatures increases on the whole from south
                to north, and that by far the greater part of the continent south of 53° N. has at
                least six months within those limits, and south of 58º N. at least five months. The
                third of the maps shows that the high temperatures which it illustrates are
                prolonged for a month or more throughout the Mediterranean region, but outside of
                that region hardly anywhere except in the south-western plains of France, the Rhone
                valley and a large area in the south-east of Russia. Without doubt an important
                cause of the prolonged duration of high temperatures in this last area is the
                relatively long duration of sunshine already mentioned as shown by <name type="person">König</name>'s map to be characteristic of south-eastern Europe.</p>
                            <p>Mention should here be made also of <name type="person">Brückner</name>'s
                remarkable treatise on the variations of climate in time. Though it deals with such
                variations over the entire land-surface of the globe, a large proportion of the data
                are derived from Europe, for which continent, accordingly, it furnishes a great
                number of particulars with regard to secular variations in temperature, rainfall,
                the date of the vintage, the frequency of cold winters, the level of rivers and
                lakes, the duration of the ice-free period of rivers (in this case all Russian), and
                other matters. Those relating to the date of the vintage are of peculiar interest.
                They apply to 29 stations in France, south-west Germany and Switzerland, and for one
                station (Dijon) go back with few breaks to the year 1391; and as the variations of
                climate of which they give an indication correspond precisely to the indications
                derived from temperature and rainfall in those periods in which we have
                corresponding data for these meteorological elements, they may be taken as
                warranting conclusions with regard to these points even for periods for which direct
                data are wanting. A period of early vintages corresponds to one of comparatively
                scanty rains and high temperatures. It is accordingly interesting to note that the
                data referred to indicate, on the whole, for Dijon an earlier vintage for the
                average of all periods of five years down to 1435 than for the average of the
                periods of the same length from 1816- 1880; but that the figures generally show no
                regular retardation from period to period, but more or less regular oscillations,
                differing in their higher and lower limits in different periods of long
                duration.</p>

                northern Switzerland, on the middle Volga and in Dalmatia and Servia. Rye covers
                more than 50 % of the grain area in the east of Holland and Belgium, in the
                north-west of Germany, in central and eastern Germany and in middle Russia. Oats are
                more cultivated than all varieties of wheat in Ireland, in the west and the northern
                half of Great Britain, in Finland and in the greater part of Denmark and
                Schleswig-Holstein. Barley is more largely cultivated than oats both in the extreme
                north and the south of the continent. Maize is cultivated to a great extent in the
                northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, in the south-west of France, in northern Italy
                and in the lands bordering the lower Danube ; in many parts covering an area equal
                to or greater than that occupied by all grain crops. Millets (various species of
                panicum) are most extensively cultivated in the south-east of Europe. The kind of
                millet known as guinea-corn or durra (<foreign xml:lang="la">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Sorghum vulgare</hi>
                                </foreign> Pers.), so extensively cultivated in Africa and India, is grown to a
                small extent on the east side and in the interior of Istria. Buckwheat is cultivated
                in the west and east of the continent—in the west from the Pyrenees to Jutland, in
                the east throughout southern and middle Russia. The potato is very largely
                cultivated in western, northern and central Europe, but has made comparatively
                little progress in Russia. The cultivation of lentils is most largely pursued in the
                west and south-west of Germany and in the south and north of France. That of lupines
                has spread with great rapidity since 1840 in the dry sandy regions of eastern
                Germany, where lupines have proved as well adapted for such soils as the more widely
                cultivated sainfoin has done for dry chalky and other limestone soils. Sugar beet is
                most largely cultivated in the extreme north of France and the adjoining parts of
                Belgium and in central Germany, to a less but still considerable extent in
                south-eastern Germany, northern Bohemia and the south-west of Russia. Flax, like
                other industrial plants, shows a tendency to concentrate itself on specially
                favourable districts. It is most extensively grown in Russia from the vicinity of
                Riga north-eastwards, even crossing in the north-east the 70th parallel of latitude;
                but it is also an important crop in the north-east of Ireland, in Belgium and
                Holland, in Lombardy and in northern Tirol. Hemp is more extensively cultivated in
                central and southern Europe, above all in Russia. Teasels are grown in various spots
                in the south-east of France and in south Germany. The cultivation of madder is not
                yet extinct in Holland and Belgium, that of weld <foreign xml:lang="la">

                            <p>The vine can be grown without protection in southern Scandinavia, and has been
                known to ripen its grapes in the open air at Christiansund in 63º 7'; but its
                cultivation is of no importance north of 47 1/2º on the Atlantic coast, 50 1/2° on
                the Rhine, and from 50° to 52° in eastern Germany, the limit falling rapidly
                southwards to the east of 17° E. The olive, with its double crop, is one of the
                principal objects of cultivation in Italy, Spain and Greece, and is not without its
                importance in Portugal, Turkey and southern Austria. Tobacco is grown to a
                considerable extent in many parts of western, central and southern Europe, for the
                most part under government regulation. The most important tobacco districts are the
                Rhine valley in Baden and Alsace, Hungary, Rumania, the banks of the Dnieper, Bosnia
                and the south-west and other parts of France. The cultivation is even carried on in
                Sweden and Great Britain, but the most northerly area in which it occupies as much
                as 0.1 % of the grain area is the Danish island of Fyen (Fünen).</p>
                            <p>Hop-growing is hardly known in the south, but forms an important industry in
                England, Austria, Germany and Belgium. Among the exotics exclusively cultivated in
                the south are the sugar-cane, the cotton plant, and rice. The first, which is found
                in Spain and Sicily, is of little practical moment; the second holds a secondary
                position in Turkey and Greece ; and the third is pretty extensively grown in special
                districts of Italy, more particularly in the valley of the Po. Even pepper is
                cultivated to a small extent in the extreme south of Spain. Of the vast number of
                fruit trees which flourish in different parts of the continent only a few can be
                mentioned. Their produce furnishes articles of export to Austria-Hungary, Germany,
                France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. In Sardinia the acorn of the <foreign xml:lang="la">

                            <p>Perhaps the most striking facts revealed by these two tables are these; first, that
                the United Kingdom is the only great wheatgrowing country which has shown a great
                decline in the amount of production in two successive periods; and, second, that
                both Germany and Russia show a great advance under both wheat and rye between the
                last two periods. This gives interest to statistics of acreage under these two
                crops, and some data under that head are given in the adjoining tables.</p>

                            <p>When the Aryan peoples began their immigration into Europe a large part of the
                surface must have been covered with primeval forest; for even after long centuries
                of human occupation the Roman conquerors found vast regions where the axe had made
                no lasting impression. The account given by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaius_Julius_Caesar">Julius Caesar</name> of the
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hercynian_Forest">
                                    <foreign xml:lang="la">Silva Hercynia</foreign>
                                </name> is well known : it extended, he tells us, for sixty days' journey from
                Helvetia eastward, and it probably included what are now called the Schwarzwald, the
                Odenwald, the Spessart, the Rhön, the Thüringerwald, the Harz, the Fichtelgebirge,
                the Erzgebirge and the Riesengebirge. Since then the progress of population has
                subjected many thousands of square miles to the plough, and in some parts of the
                continent it is only where the ground is too sterile or too steep that the trees
                have been allowed to retain possession. Several countries, where the destruction has
                been most reckless, have been obliged to take systematic measures to control the
                exploitation and secure the replantation of exhausted areas. To this they have been
                constrained not only by lack of timber and fuel but also by the prejudicial effects
                exerted on the climate and the irrigation of the country by the denudation of the
                high grounds. But even now, on the whole, Europe is well wooded, and two or three
                countries find an extensive source of wealth in the export of timber and other
                forest productions, such as turpentine, tar, charcoal, bark, bast and potash.</p>

                            <p>Horse-breeding is a highly important industry in almost all European countries, and
                in several, as Russia, France, Hungary and Spain, the state gives it exceptional
                support. Almost every district of the continent has a breed of its own: Russia
                reckons those of the Bashkirs, the Kalmucks, the Don-Cossacks, the Esthonians and
                the Finlanders as among its best; France sets store by those of Flanders, Picardy,
                Normandv, Limousin <pb n="915" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0915.png"/> and
                Auvergne; Germany by those of Hanover, Oldenburg and Mecklenburg, which indeed rank
                among the most powerful in the world ; and Great Britain by those of Suffolk and
                Clydesdale. The English racers are famous throughout the world, and Iceland and the
                Shetland Islands are well known for their hardy breed of diminutive ponies. The ass
                and the mule are most abundant in the southern parts of the continent, more
                especially in Spain, Italy and Greece. The camel is not popularly considered a
                European animal; but it is reared in Russia in the provinces of Orenburg, Astrakhan
                and Taurid, in Turkey on the Lower Danube, and in Spain at Madrid and Cadiz ; and it
                has even been introduced into Tuscany. A much more important beast of burden in
                eastern and southern Europe is the ox: the long lines of slow-moving wains in
                Rumania, for example, are not unlike what one would expect in Cape Colony. In
                western Europe it is mainly used for the plough or fattened for its flesh. It is
                estimated that there are about 100 distinct local varieties or breeds in Europe, and
                within the last hundred years an enormous advance has been made in the development
                and specialization of the finer types. The cows of Switzerland and of Guernsey may
                be taken as the two extremes in point of size, and the <q>"Durhams"</q> and <q>"
                  Devonshires"</q> of England as examples of the results of human supervision and
                control. The Dutch breed ranks very high in the production of milk. The buffalo is
                frequent in the south of Europe, more especially in the countries on the Lower
                Danube and in southern Italy. Sheep are of immense economic value to most European
                countries, above all to Spain and Portugal, Great Britain, France, Hungary, the
                countries of the Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic provinces of Germany and the
                south-east of Russia. The local varieties are even more numerous than in the case of
                the horned cattle, and the development of remarkable breeds quite as wonderful. In
                all the more mountainous countries the goat is abundant, especially in Spain, Italy
                and Germany. The pig is distributed throughout the whole continent, but in no
                district does it take so high a place as in Servia. In the rearing and management of
                poultry France is the first country in Europe, and has consequently a large surplus
                of both fowls and eggs. In Pomerania, Brandenburg, West Prussia, Mecklenburg and
                Wurttemberg the breeding of geese has become a great source of wealth, and the town
                of Strassburg is famous all the world over for its <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                </foreign>. Under this heading may also be mentioned the domesticated insects, the
                silkworm, the bee and the cantharis. The silkworm is most extensively reared in
                northern Italy, but also in the southern parts of the Rhone valley in France, and to
                a smaller extent in several other Mediterranean and southern countries. Bee-keeping
                is widespread. The cantharis is largely reared in Spain, but also in other countries
                in southern and central Europe.</p>

                            <p>The most important mineral products of Europe are coal and iron ore. In order of
                production the leading coal-producing countries have long been the United Kingdom,
                Germany, France and Belgium. Since 1897 Russia has held the fifth place, followed by
                Austria-Hungary, Spain and Sweden. The production in other countries is
                insignificant. Besides coal, lignite is produced in great amount in Germany and
                Austria-Hungary, and to a small amount in France, Italy and a few other countries.
                Down to 1895 the United Kingdom stood first among the iron-ore producing countries
                of Europe, but since 1896 the order under this head has been <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zollverein">the German
                  Customs' Union</name>, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Russia, Sweden,
                Austria-Hungary and Belgium. By far the most important iron-ore producing district
                of Europe is that which lies on different slopes of the hills in which German
                Lorraine, the grand duchy of Luxemburg and France meet, the district producing all
                the ore of Luxemburg and the principal supplies of Germany and France. Another
                important producing district is what is known as the Siegerland on the confines of
                the Prussian provinces of the Rhine and Westphalia. Next in importance to these are
                the iron-ore deposits of the United Kingdom, the chief being those of the Cleveland
                district south of the Tees, and the hematite fields of Cumberland and Furness.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the mineral production of Europe generally, perhaps the most notable
                fact to record is the relatively lower place taken by the United Kingdom in the
                production both of coal and iron. Here it is enough to state the main results. In
                the production of coal the United Kingdom is indeed still far ahead of all other
                European countries, but notwithstanding the fact that the British export of coal has
                been increasing much more rapidly than the production, this country has not been
                able to keep pace with Germany and Russia in the rate of increase of production. In
                1878 the production of coal in the German empire was only about 34 % of that of the
                United Kingdom, but in 1906 it had grown to nearly 50 %. This, too, was exclusive of
                lignite, the production of which in Germany is increasing still more rapidly. It was
                equal to little more than one-fourth of the coal production in 1878, but more than
                two-fifths in 1906. The coal production of Russia (mainly European Russia) is still
                relatively small, but it is increasing more rapidly than that of any other European
                country. While in 1878 it was little more than 2 % of that of the United Kingdom, in
                1906 the corresponding ratio was above 8 %. In the production of iron ores the
                decline in the position of the United Kingdom is much more marked. The production
                reached a maximum in 1882 (18,032,000 tons), and since then it has sunk in one year
                (1893) as low as 11,200,000 tons, while, on the other hand, there was a rapid
                increase in the production of such ores in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zollverein">the German Zollverein (including
                  Luxemburg)</name>, France, Spain, Sweden and Russia, down to 1900, with a more
                progressive movement, in spite of fluctuations, in all these countries than in the
                United Kingdom in more recent years. In the total amount of production the United
                Kingdom in 1905 took the second place. While in 1878 the production of iron ores in
                  <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zollverein">the German
                  Zollverein (including Luxemburg)</name> was little more than a third of that in
                the United Kingdom, in 1905 it exceeded that of the United Kingdom by nearly 60
                %.</p>
                            <p>An indication of the relative importance of different European countries in the
                production of ores and metals of less aggregate value than coal and iron is given in

                            <p>Platinum has hitherto been obtained nowhere in Europe except in the auriferous
                sands in the Russian government of Perm. Nickel is derived from Germany, Norway and
                Sweden ; antimony from Germany and Hungary; bismuth from Saxony and Bohemia.
                Bauxite, which is used in the manufacture of aluminium, is obtained from France,
                Styria and Ireland. In order of importance the chief salt-producing countries are
                the United Kingdom (in which for some years the amount produced has been for the
                most part stationary or declining), Germany (which is rapidly increasing its
                production), Russia, France, Spain, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Rumania and Switzerland.
                Besides common salt Germany has for many years been producing a rapidly increasing
                amount of potash salts, of which it has almost a monopoly. Italy (chiefly Sicily) is
                by far the most <pb n="916" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0916.png"/> important
                producer of sulphur. Among other mineral products may be mentioned the boric acid
                and statuary marble of Tuscany, the statuary marble of Greece, the asphalt of
                Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Austria-Hungary, the slates of Wales, Scotland and
                France, the kaolin of Germany, England and France, and the abundant glass sands of
                Belgium, France and Bohemia.</p>

                            <p>With regard to commerce, industries and railways, as a whole, Europe may be said to
                be characterized by the rapid development of manufacturing at the expense of
                agricultural industry. With few exceptions the countries of Europe that export
                agricultural products are able to spare a diminishing proportion of the aggregate of
                such produce for export. Other countries are becoming more and more dependent on
                imported agricultural products. Most European countries, even if not able to export
                a large proportion of manufactured articles, are at least securing a greater and
                greater command of the home market for such products.<note>Probably the most

                centres of manufacturing industry are extending the range of their markets. All
                these changes have been largely, if not chiefly, promoted by the improvements in the
                means of communication, and the methods of transport by sea and land. Larger ships
                more economically propelled have brought grain at a cheaper and cheaper rate from
                all parts of the world, and improved methods of refrigeration have made fresh meat,
                butter and other perishable commodities even from the southern hemisphere articles
                of rapidly growing importance in European markets. Improvements in transport have
                likewise tended to cheapen British coal in many parts of the mainland of Europe. On
                the other hand, the extension of the railway network of the continent has brought a
                wider area within the domain of the manufacturing regions associated with the
                coalfields occurring at intervals in central Europe from the upper Oder to the basin
                of the Ruhr, as well as some of the more detached coalfields of Russia. As affecting
                the relative advantages of different European countries for carrying on
                manufacturing industry, three inventions or discoveries of recent years may be
                mentioned as of capital importance: <list>
                                    <item>(1) the invention in 1879 of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sidney_Gilchrist_Thomas">Thomas</name>
                    process for the manufacture of ingot iron and steel from the phosphoric iron
                    ores, an invention which gave a greatly enhanced value to the ores on the
                    borders of Lorraine, Luxemburg and Alsace, as well as others both in England and
                    on the continent;</item>
                                    <item>(2) the invention of efficient machines for the application of power by
                    means of electricity, an invention which gave greatly increased importance to
                    the water-power of mountainous countries;</item>
                                    <item>and (3) the discovery of the fact that from lignite an even higher grade of
                    producer gas may be obtained than from coal, a discovery obviously of special
                    importance for the great lignite-producing districts of Germany and
                    Bohemia</item>

                            <p>The figures derived from tho three recent industrial censuses of Switzerland are
                very instructive, especially if one is justified in including the electric among the
                hydraulic installations. The estimates that have been made of the total available
                water-power in a few European countries are mostly based on such problematical data
                that they are not worth giving. One very uncertain element in such calculations is
                the amount of water-power that is capable of being artificially created by the
                construction of valley-dams, such as have been erected on a small scale in the Harz
                and other mining and smelting regions of Germany from an early date, and are now
                being built on a much larger scale in the Rhine region and other parts of Europe, or
                is incidentally provided in the construction of canals.</p>

                lies the greater is the saving of distance. The precise direction of the routes has
                been very largely fixed, however, by the physical features ; by the course of the
                rivers where navigable rivers formed parts of the routes; in other cases by the
                situation and form of the mountains, or the direction of the river valleys which is
                implied in the form of the mountains. From the Black Sea the most convenient
                starting-point is obviously towards the west, and two connecting routes with the
                Baltic lie wholly to the east of the mountains. One route makes use of the Bug or
                the Dniester, the San and the Vistula so far as possible, while another starting in
                the same way proceeds round the foot-hills of the Carpathians, thus finding easy
                crossing places on the head-streams of the rivers, as far as the Oder and then down
                that stream. Another route is up the Danube to the neighbourhood of Vienna, and then
                north-eastwards through the opening between the Carpathians and the Sudetic range to
                the head-waters of the Oder, crossing a water-parting little more than 1000 ft. in
                altitude. The first route was certainly used again and again by the ancient Greeks,
                starting from Olbia near the mouth of the Bug, the objective point being the coast
                in the south-east of the Baltic supplying the amber which was so important an
                article of commerce in early times. This route was again much used in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
                ages</name>, when Visby, on Gotland,- undoubtedly selected on account of the
                security afforded by an island station, was for hundreds of years an important
                centre of trade both in northern products (of which furs were the most valuable) and
                those of the East (pepper and other spices, silks and other costly articles).
                Numerous coins, Roman, Byzantine and Arabic, found not merely in Gotland itself but
                also at various points along the route indicated, testify to the long-continued
                importance of this route. In <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> the Oder
                route was also largely used whether reached by rounding the Carpathians or ascending
                the Danube, and in connexion with that route the island of Bornholm long formed a
                focus of commerce answering to that in Gotland farther east. The Danube route was
                also made use of farther west, and formed a large part of a great route connecting
                the East with the north-west of Europe. The valuable goods of the Orient could be
                conveyed up-stream as high as Ratisbon (Regensburg), and thence north-westward
                across Nuremberg to Frankfort-on-Main, from which access was had to the Rhine gorge
                leading on to Cologne and the ports of Dordrecht and Rotterdam, Bruges and Ghent; or
                they could be carried still farther up-stream to Ulm, thence by a route winding
                through the north of the Black Forest to Strassburg and from that point north of the
                Vosges to the Marne and Seine.</p>
                            <p>Farther west use was made at an early date of passes by which the whole system of
                the Alps could be crossed, or partly crossed and partly rounded, in a single rise.

                Baltic but also on the eastern shores of the North Sea north of the Rhine mouths,
                made regular use of at least three such passes. One of these was the Brenner, the
                summit of which is under 4500 ft. in height, approached on the south side by the
                valley of the Adige and its tributary the Eisak, on the other side by the Inn valley
                and that of its small tributary the Sill. By this route the Alps at about their
                widest are crossed with exceptional ease; and hence it was natural that it should
                have been used by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etruscan_civilization">the Etruscans</name> to
                reach the amber shores of the Baltic, and in all subsequent periods in intercourse
                between central Europe and northern Italy. In their trade with the mouth of the
                Rhine <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etruscan_civilization">the Etruscans</name> appear to have used only the passes approached by the Dora
                Baltea, which leads equally to the Little St Bernard, to the south of Mont Blanc,
                and so to the Isere valley and the Rhone, and to the Great St Bernard, to the east
                of Mont Blanc, and so directly to the Rhone valley above the Lake of Geneva, by
                which route the remainder of the Alps could be rounded on the west and the Rhine
                valley reached by crossing the northern Jura. Roman roads were afterwards made
                across all these passes, although that across the Great St Bernard (the highest of
                all, above 8100 ft.) seems never to have been made practicable for carriages. The
                Romans also made use of three intervening passes by which in a single rise from the
                Po basin the heads of valleys leading right down to the head of Lake Constance could
                be reached. These were the Bernardino, Splügen and Septimer, to mention them in the
                order from west to east. By the Romans the Simplon was also made use of as affording
                the most direct connexion between Milan and the upper Rhone valley. All these passes
                were likewise in use in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> when Venice
                and Genoa were the great intermediaries in the trade in pepper and spices and other
                Oriental products. The Brenner afforded the most direct connexion between Venice and
                southern Germany, on a route leading also to northern Germany by way of Ratisbon and
                afterwards the rivers of the Elbe basin, and finally (from the end of the 14th
                century) by a canal to Lübeck, which was the great distributing centre of these and
                other products for the Baltic. To take the most direct route to the Rhine valley and
                north-western Europe some other pass (the Seefeld or the Fern) in the Bavarian Alps
                had to be crossed and the Rhine valley reached by Augsburg, and thence either by way
                of Ulm or Frankfort. From Genoa the routes in the early <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">middle ages</name> were by way of
                Milan to the Lake of Constance, and thence by way of Ulm if the Rhine valley was the
                goal, and by way of Augsburg if it was the Baltic. The St Gotthard route, the most
                direct connexion between Milan and the north of the Alps, was added about the end of
                the 13th century. The Mont Cenis pass from an early date afforded the most direct
                connexion between Genoa and the middle Rhone valley by way of Turin. When modern
                carriage roads came to be built it was still the same routes that were chosen. The
                road across the Brenner, completed in 1772, was the first of these. The building of
                the great Swiss carriage roads across the passes in the early part of the 19th
                century was inaugurated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s road
                across the Simplon completed in 1805. A later paragraph will show that modern
                railways follow much the same, if not exactly the same, routes. On the early use of
                the Saône-Rhone valleys, and the route between the foothills of the Cevennes and the
                Pyrenees, it is not necessary to insist, but it may be mentioned that English tin
                was sometimes conveyed to the Mediterranean (Marseilles) by this latter route in
                Roman times.</p>

                            <p>Since the introduction of railways inland waterways have in most countries taken a
                very inferior position as means of transport. The articles on the different
                countries supply the necessary information with respect to those which have a purely
                national interest, but here mention must be made of those which have significance as
                belonging to trans-European routes or have an international value. The importance of
                shortening the water-route between the opposite sides of the great European isthmus
                separating the Baltic and the Black Sea is brought into prominence by the constant
                revival of projects for a ship-canal connecting those coasts. A definite step taken
                with a view to carrying out such a project was the sanction given by the tsar in
                April 1905 for the appointment of a special commission to inquire into the
                practicability of a scheme for the excavation of a canal about 28 ft. deep between
                Riga and Kherson, utilizing the waters of the Diina or western Dvina, the Berezina
                and Dnieper. Since the completion in 1845 of the Ludwigs or Danube-Main Canal,
                running from the Main near Bamberg to Kelheim on the Danube, it has been possible to
                go by water from the mouth of the Rhine to the mouth of the Danube ; but this canal
                has in reality no trans-European significance. It cannot take barges of a greater
                capacity than 125 tons, is not adapted for steamers, and carries only a very small
                amount of traffic. But projects for connecting the Danube with northern Europe by
                water are still entertained. Of these the most advanced are those for establishing
                connexions through Austria. On the 11th of June 1901 the Austrian diet passed an act
                prescribing the construction of a canal connecting the Oder with the Danube through
                the Morava, and another connecting the Danube at Linz with the Moldau-Elbe, and the
                improvement of the navigation on the connected waterways. The Oder-Danube canal thus
                authorized would have to cross a watershed of little more than 1000 ft. in altitude
                as against 1365 ft. in the case of the Ludwigs Canal; but the Elbe-Danube Canal
                would have to cross one of about 2250 ft. Under the provisions of the act the work
                is to be completed by 1924. In Germany projects have been actively agitated for
                improving the Danube-Main connexion either wholly or partly along the route of the
                present canal, and for establishing a new connexion by means of a canal of at least
                6 1/2 ft. in depth by way of the Neckar, the Rems and the Brenz, joining the Danube
                at Lauingen about midway between Ulm and Donauworth. The Moldau-Elbe is itself an
                important international waterway, inasmuch as it allows of steamer traffic from
                Prague in Bohemia to Hamburg, and by means of a connecting canal to Lübeck. But the
                most important of all international waterways in Europe is the Rhine, on which even
                sea-going steamers regularly ascend to Cologne, and an amount of traffic crosses the
                Dutch frontier three or four times as great as that which makes use of the
                Manchester ship-canal. The river is also navigable to Basel in Switzerland, though
                above Strassburg the river is little used, being replaced since 1834 by the Rhine
                and Rhone canal, which connects the two rivers through the Ill and the Saône. The
                Rhine is also connected with the Seine by the Marne and Rhine canal passing north of
                the Vosges, and its tributary the Moselle is also navigable from France into
                Germany. The Meuse again is navigable from France through Belgium into Holland, and
                is connected by more than one route with the Seine, and in the densely peopled
                mining and manufacturing country in the north of France and the adjoining parts of
                Belgium numerous waterways ramify in different directions. Even in an article on
                Europe the entirely French canals connecting the Seine and Rhone (Burgundy canal,
                summit-level 1230 ft., completed 1832), the Loire and Rhone (Canal du Centre,
                summit-level 990 ft., completed in 1793), and the Canal du Midi, connecting the
                Garonne at Toulouse with Cette on the Mediterranean, may be mentioned inasmuch as
                they establish communication between different seas. The last is of special interest
                because it is the oldest (completed in 1681), because it makes use of the lowest
                crossing, surmounting the passage of Naurouse, or Gap of Carcassonne, at an altitude
                of 625 ft., and because it effects the greatest shortening of distance from sea to
                sea. On this account the project of establishing a ship-canal of modern dimensions
                along this route has been as often revived as that of the Black Sea and Baltic
                canal. In the east of Europe the Vistula and Memel are both international waterways,
                but they are of little importance compared with those in the west. The Kaiser
                Wilhelm or North Sea and Baltic canal, opened in 1895, has, however, no little
                international value, inasmuch as it shortens the sea-route to the Baltic for all
                North Sea ports to the south of Newcastle, and affords the means of avoiding a
                rather dangerous passage round the north of Jutland. A minor degree of international
                interest belongs to the ship-canal through the Isthmus of Corinth, opened on the 6th
                of August 1893.</p>

                            <p>The chief railways of most European countries are on the same gauge as that
                originally adopted in Great Britain, namely, 4 ft. 8 1/2 in. Irish railways are,
                however, on the gauge of 5 ft. 3 in. The standard gauge in Russia is 5 ft., that of
                Spain and Portugal about 5 ft. 6 in. The still isolated railway system of Greece is
                upon a narrow gauge. The very general use of a common gauge obviously greatly
                facilitates international trade. It allows, for example, of wagons from Germany
                entering every country on its frontier except Russia. It allows of German coal being
                carried without break of bulk to Paris, Milan and the mainland of Denmark. By means
                of train ferries German trains can also be conveyed to Copenhagen by way of
                Warnemunde and Gjedser and then across the channel separating Falster and Zealand
                and there is a similar means of communication between Copenhagen and Malmo (Sweden)
                and between Lindau in Bavaria on the Lake of Constance and Romanshorn on the same
                lake in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. The establishment of this method of transport
                between England and France has been urged in opposition to the Channel Tunnel
                scheme.</p>
                            <p>Of the railway systems of the mainland of Europe as a whole the main features are
                these. There is a broad belt running from the North Sea eastwards between the lines
                marked by Amsterdam and Hanover on the north, and Calais, Liege, Dusseldorf and
                Halle on the south, in which important lines of railway run from west to east. About
                12º E these lines begin to converge on Berlin. This belt is crossed in the Rhine
                valley by a much narrower but very important belt running north and south, now
                connected with the Italian railway system through the St Gotthard tunnel. To the
                south of the west end of the west-to-east belt lies the principal railway focus in
                western Europe, Paris, from which important lines radiate in all directions two of
                these radiating lines now establish communication with the Italian railway system,
                through the Mont Cenis and Simplon tunnels respectively, and other two connecting
                with the Spanish system round the ends of the Pyrenees. Berlin in central Europe is
                perhaps an even more important railway focus. Among the chief lines radiating from
                it are one through Leipzig and Munich and connecting with the Italian railway system
                by the Brenner route, and another through Dresden and Prague to Vienna, and then by
                the Semmering pass by one route to Triest and by another to Venice. East of Berlin
                the railways of Europe begin to form wider meshes. Two main lines diverge towards
                the north east, one by Kustrin and Konigsberg and the other by Trankfort on the Oder
                and Thorn, both uniting at Eydtkuhnen to the east of Konigsberg before crossing the
                Prussian frontier and passing on to St Petersburg. From Thorn a line branches off by
                Warsaw to Moscow, the chief railway focus in eastern Europe. South-east from Berlin
                there runs another important line through Breslau, Cracow and Lemberg to Odessa,
                skirting to a large extent the foot lulls of the Carpathians like the ancient trade
                route from Olbia to the Baltic. Two routes on which there are services organized by
                  <name type="institution">the International Sleeping Car Company</name> connect
                London with Constantinople, and it is noteworthy that both of these indicate the
                importance of the physical feature which has determined the position of the great
                north south belt of railways above mentioned, and also of towns famous as commercial
                centres in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the
                  middle ages</name>. One of these is the route of the Orient Express, which goes by
                Calais, Paris and Strassburg, then east of Strassburg runs north in the Rhine valley
                for about 40 m to Karlsruhe, then winds through the hilly country between the Black
                Forest proper and the Odenwald to Stuttgart, proceeding thence by Ulm, Augsburg and
                Munich to Linz and then by the valley of the Danube through Vienna and Budapest to
                Belgrade, and thence by the valleys of the Morava, Nishava and Mantza to
                Constantinople. The other is that of the Ostend-Vienna express, going by Ostend to
                Brussels and through Aix la-Chapelle to Cologne, then up the Rhine gorge southwards
                to Bingen and eastwards to Mainz and on to Frankfort (on the Main), thence
                south-eastwards by the route so celebrated in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> through
                Nuremberg to Regensburg (Ratisbon), and thence down the valley of the Danube
                coinciding with the Orient Express route from a point a few miles above Linz. From
                the Orient Express route a branch crosses from the valley of the Morava to that of
                the Vardar, establishing a connexion with Salonica.</p>
                            <p>In the development of this railway system the mountains have proved the most
                formidable of natural obstacles, and at the head of the mountains in this respect as
                in others stand the Alps. The first railway to cross one of the main chains of the
                Alps was the Semmering line on the route from Vienna to the Adriatic, constructed in
                1848- 1854. Its summit is in a tunnel less than 1 m long, 2940 ft above sea level or
                nearly 300 ft below the level of the pass. South of the Semmering, however, various
                other passes have to be crossed, and it was not till 1857 that the railway to Triest
                (by Laibach) was completed, and not till the late seventies that the more direct
                route to Venice across the Tarvis pass in Carinthia was established. Of the route
                from Triest by Gorz across the Karawanken and Tauern Alps to Salzburg and south
                eastern Germany the first section was opened only in 1906. After the Semmering the
                next railway to cross the Alps was that following the Brenner route which crosses
                the summit of the pass at the height of 4490 ft., and, as already stated, is the
                only pass that has to be crossed on the way from Munich to the plains of Italy. Next
                followed in 1871 the western route through the so-called Mont Cenis tunnel, really
                under the Col de Fréjus, to the west of the Mont Cenis pass, and effecting a
                crossing between the valleys of the Arc (Rhone basin) and the Dora Riparia (Po
                basin) at an altitude of 4380 ft., or nearly 2500 ft lower than the pass previously
                used, but only by piercing the mountains in a tunnel more than 7 1/2 m long. Next in
                order was the St Gotthard route opened in 1882, the most direct route between
                northern Italy and western Germany, connecting the Lake of Lucerne with the valley
                of the Ticino. Here the altitude is reduced to 3785 ft, about 3150 ft below the
                summit level of the pass, but the tunnel length is increased to rather more than 9
                1/2 m. The Simplon route opened in June 1906, between the upper Rhone valley and the
                Toce valley, shortening the route between Milan and northern France, effects the
                crossing at an altitude of only 2300 ft, nearly 4300 ft lower than the pass, but by
                increasing the tunnel length to 12 1/4 m. Steps were subsequently taken to continue
                the Simplon route northwards by a tunnel through the Lotschberg in the Bernese Alps,
                and a project is entertained for continuing the Vintschgau (upper Adige) railway
                across or under the Reschenscheideck to the Inn valley. An important east-west
                crossing of the Alps was effected when the Arlberg tunnel (<damage>6 37</damage>
                                <note type="uncertainty" resp="#alexey.gorobiy">In the original there was probably
                  some symbol between "6" and "37". – Alexey Gorobiy</note> m long summit level 4300
                ft) connecting the Inn valley with that of the Rhine above the Lake of Constance was
                opened in 1884.</p>
                            <p>Several lines wind through and cross the Jura. That which in 1857 pierced the
                Hauenstein, in the north of Switzerland, attained international importance on the
                opening of the St Gotthard tunnel, inasmuch as it lies on the route thence through
                Lucerne to the Rhine valley at Basel, and that which crosses the Col de Jougne
                between Vallorbe and Pontarher acquired similar importance on the completion of the
                Simplon tunnel. Further projects are entertained for shortening the connexion
                between this tunnel and the north of France by making a more direct line from
                Vallorbe to the French side of the Jura, or by making a railway across or under the
                Col de la Faucille (4340 ft), north west of Geneva.</p>
                            <p>Of the two railways that pass round the extremity of the Pyrenees, the western was
                the first to be constructed, the eastern was not opened till 1878. Hitherto the
                intervening mountains have proved more of a railway barrier than the mightier system
                of the Alps, but in 1904 a convention was concluded between the French and Spanish
                governments providing for the establishment of railway connexion between the two
                countries at three points of the great chain.</p>
                            <p>There are several railways across the Carpathians, mostly by passes under 3000 ft
                in height. The fact that the Tomos Pass, on the direct route from Hungary through
                Transylvania to Bucharest, attains an altitude of 3370 ft was undoubtedly one reason
                why the railway following this route, completed in December 1879, passing through
                several tunnels, was one of the last to be constructed. But the obstruction of
                mountains has not been the only cause of delay in the building of railways.
                Sparseness of population and general economic backwardness have also proved
                hindrances, especially in Russia and the Balkan Peninsula. The railways to
                Constantinople and Salonica were completed only in 1888, and yet the highest
                altitude on the Constantinople line is only 2400 ft, that on the Salonica line 1750
                ft. Among other important railways of recent date and of more than merely national
                significance may be mentioned that bringing Bucharest into connexion with the Black
                Sea port of Costantza by means of a bridge across the Danube at Chernavoda (opened
                in September 1895), a line across the Carpathians connecting Debreczen with Lemberg,
                the continuation of the line eastwards from Lemberg to Kiev, a network bringing the
                coalfield of the Donets basin into connexion with ports on the Sea of Azov, a line
                in the south east of Russia connecting Novocherkask with Vladikavkaz, and branches
                running from the same point connecting that line with Novorossiysk on the Black Sea
                on the one hand and with Tsaritsyn at the last angle of the Volga on the other hand,
                a line in northern Russia bringing Archangel into connexion with the European system
                at Vologda (opened in 1898), a detached line in the north-east across the Urals from
                Perm by Ekaterinburg (completed in 1878) to Tyumen (completed in 1884). Chelyabinsk
                on the Siberian railway has a branch running northwards to Ekaterinburg, and this
                line now affords uninterrupted communication with the northern Dvina, inasmuch as
                the railway which originally started at Perm has been carried westwards through
                Vyatka and then northwards to Kotlas at the point of origin of that river, to which
                point it was opened in 1900, and a line in the east connecting the European system
                at Samara with the great mining centre at Zlatoust, already in 1890 continued across
                the Urals to Miyas, and since then carried farther east as the great Siberian
                railway.</p>
                            <p>The result of the construction of the numerous transcontinental railways has been
                to bring rail and sea routes and ports on opposite sides of the continents into
                competition with one another to a greater degree than is possible in any other
                continent. The more valuable, and above all perishable commodities may be sent right
                across the continent even through the mountains. Even from Great Britain, which is
                bound to carry on its external commerce in part by sea, goods are sometimes sent far
                south in Italy by railways running from one or other of the North Sea ports. It will
                hence be readily understood that for inland trade on the mainland the competition
                between ports on opposite sides of the continent and between different railways will
                be very keen greatly to the advantage of the inland centres to which that
                competition extends. This competition is inevitably all the more keen now that the
                trade of Europe with <pb n="919" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0919.png"/> the
                East is once more carried on through the Mediterranean as it was in ancient times
                and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
                  ages</name>. The great shortening of the sea-route in this trade at such ports as
                Marseilles, Triest, Venice and Genoa, indicated by the figures below, goes far to
                counterbalance the extra cost even of railway transport across the mountains. <table rows="5" cols="5">

                            <p>An enormous amount of investigation with regard to European ethnology has been
                carried on in recent years. These labours have chiefly consisted in the study of the
                physical type of different countries or districts, but it is not necessary to
                consider in detail the results arrived at. It should, however, be pointed out that
                the idea of an Aryan race may be regarded as definitely abandoned. One cannot even
                speak with assurance of the diffusion of an Aryan civilization. It is at least not
                certain that the civilization that was spread by the migration of peoples speaking
                Aryan tongues originated amongst and remained for a time peculiar to such peoples.
                The utmost that can be said is that the Aryan languages must in their earliest forms
                have spread from some geographical centre. That centre, however, is no longer sought
                for in Asia, but in some part of Europe, so that we can no longer speak of any
                detachment of Aryan-speaking peoples entering Europe.</p>
                            <p>The most important works, summarizing the labours of a host of specialists on the
                races of Europe, are those of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Z._Ripley">Ripley</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Deniker">Deniker</name>.

                multitude of data that have been collected with regard to the form of the head, face
                and nose, height, and colour of the hair and eyes, most of the leading
                anthropologists seem to have come to the conclusion that there are three great
                racial types variously and intricately intermingled in Europe. As described and
                named by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Z._Ripley">Ripley</name>, these are: <list>
                                    <item>(1) the Teutonic, characterized by long head and face and narrow aquiline
                    nose, high stature, very light hair and blue eyes;</item>
                                    <item>(2) the Alpine, characterized by round head, broad face, variable rather
                    broad heavy nose, medium height and <q>" stocky "</q> frame, light chestnut hair
                    and hazel grey eyes;</item>
                                    <item>and (3) the Mediterranean, characterized by long head and face, rather broad
                    nose, medium stature and slender build, dark brown or black hair and dark
                    eyes</item>
                                </list>. The Teutonic race is entirely confined to northwestern Europe, and embraces
                some groups speaking Celtic languages. It is believed by <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Z._Ripley">Ripley</name> to have been differentiated in this continent, and to have
                  originally been one with the other long-headed race, sometimes known as the
                  Iberian, and to the Italians as the Ligurian race, which <quote>" prevails
                    everywhere south of the Pyrenees, along the southern coast of France, and in
                    southern Italy, including Sicily and Sardinia,"</quote> and which extends beyond
                  the confines of Europe into Africa. The Alpine race is geographically intermediate
                  between these two, having its centre in the Alps, while in western Europe it is
                  spread most widely over the more elevated regions, and in eastern Europe <quote>"
                    becomes less pure in proportion as we go east from the Carpathians across the
                    great plains of European Russia."</quote>
                                </ref> This last race, which is most persistently characterized by the shape of the
                head, is regarded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Z._Ripley">Ripley</name> as an intrusive
                Asiatic element which once advanced as a wedge amongst the earlier long-headed
                population as far as Brittany, where i t still survives in relative purity, and even
                into Great Britain, though not Ireland, but afterwards retired and contracted its
                area before an advance of the long-headed races. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Deniker">Deniker</name>, basing his
                classification on essentially the same data as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Z._Ripley">Ripley</name> and others,
                while agreeing with them almost entirely with regard to the distribution of the
                three main traits (cephalic index, colour of hair and eyes, and stature) on which
                anthropologists rely, yet proceeds further in the subdivision of the races of
                Europe. He recognizes six principal and four secondary races. The six principal
                races are the Nordic (answering approximately to the Teutonic of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Z._Ripley">Ripley</name>), the Littoral
                or Atlanto-Mediterranean, the Ibero-Insular, the Oriental, the Adriatic or Dinaric
                and the Occidental or Cevenole.</p>

                or ecclesiastical liturgies. Besides all those which are spoken over extensive
                territories, and some even which are confined within very narrow limits, are broken
                up into several distinct dialects.</p>

                            <p>The boundaries of European countries have of course been determined by history, and
                in some cases only historical events can be held to account for their general
                situation, the influence of geographical conditions being seen only on a minute
                examination of details. In most cases, however, it is otherwise. The present
                political boundaries were all settled when the general distribution of population in
                the continent was in a large measure determined by the geographical conditions, and
                accordingly the lines along which they run for the most part show the influence of
                such conditions very clearly, and thus present in many cases a marked contrast to
                the political boundaries in America and Australia, where the boundaries have often
                been marked out in advance of the population. In Europe the general rule is that the
                boundaries tend to run through some thinly peopled strip or tract of country, such
                as is formed by mountain ranges, elevated tablelands too bleak for cultivation,
                relatively high ground of no great altitude where soil and climate are less
                favourable to cultivation than the lower land on either side, or low ground occupied
                by heaths or marshes or some other sterile soil; but it is the exception for
                important navigable rivers to form boundaries between countries or even between
                important administrative divisions of countries, and for such exceptions a special
                explanation can generally be found. Navigable rivers unite rather than separate, for
                the obvious reason that they generally flow through populous valleys, and the
                vessels that pass up and down can touch as easily on one side as the other. Minor
                rivers, on the other hand, flowing through sparsely peopled valleys frequently form
                portions of political boundaries simply because they are convenient lines of
                demarcation. A brief examination of the present political map of Europe will serve
                to illustrate these rules.</p>
                            <p>The eastern frontier of the Netherlands begins by running southwards through a
                marsh nearly parallel to the Ems but nowhere touching it, then winds south or
                south-westwards through a rather sparsely peopled district to the Rhine. This river
                it crosses. It then approaches but does not touch the Meuse, but runs for a
                considerable distance roughly parallel to that river along higher ground, where the
                population is much more scanty than in the valley. On the side of Belgium the Dutch
                boundary is for the most part thoroughly typical, winding between the dreariest
                parts of the Dutch or Belgium provinces of North Brabant, Limburg and Antwerp. The
                Scheldt nowhere forms a boundary between countries, not even at its wide estuary.
                The eastern frontier of Belgium is quite typical both on the side of Germany and
                Luxemburg. It is otherwise, however, on the south, where that country confines with
                France, and indeed the whole of the north-east frontier of France may be called a
                historical frontier, showing the influence of geographical conditions only in
                details. One of these details, however, deserves attention, the tongue in which it
                advances northwards into Belgium so as to give to France the natural fortress of
                Givet, a tongue, be it noted, the outline of which is as typical a boundary as is to
                be seen in Europe in respect of scantiness of population, apart from the
                fortress.</p>
                            <p>The mountainous frontiers of France on the east and south require hardly any
                comment. Only in the Burgundy Gate between the Vosges and the Jura has an artificial
                boundary had to be drawn, and even that in a minor degree illustrates the general
                rule. The division of the Iberian peninsula between Spain and Portugal goes back in
                effect to the Christian reaction against the Moors. The valley of the Miňo and its
                tributaries establishes a natural connexion between Galicia and the rest of Spain ;
                but an independent crusade against the Moors starting from the lower part of the
                valley of the Douro resulted in the formation of the kingdom of Portugal, which
                found its natural eastern limit on the scantily peopled margin of the Iberian
                tableland, where the rivers cease to be navigable and flow through narrow gorges,
                that of the Tagus, where the river marks the frontier, being almost without
                inhabitants, especially on the Spanish side.</p>
                            <p>The greater part of the Italian boundary is very clearly marked geographically,
                though we have to look back to the weakness of divided Italy to account for the
                instances in which northern mountaineers have pushed their way into southern Alpine
                valleys. Even in these parts, however, there are interesting illustrations of
                geographical influence in the way in which the Italian boundary crosses the northern
                ends of the Lago Maggiore and the Lake of Garda, and cuts off portions of Lake
                Lugano both in the east and west. In all these cases the frontier crosses from one
                steep unpeopled slope to another, assigning the population at different ends or on
                different sides of the lakes to the country to which belongs the adjacent population
                not lying on their shores.</p>
                            <p>Of the Swiss frontiers all that it is necessary to remark is that the river Rhine
                in more than one place marks the boundary, in one, however, where it traverses
                alluvial flats liable to inundation (on the side of Austria), in the other place
                where it rushes through a gorge below the falls of Schaffhausen. The southern
                frontier of Germany is almost throughout typical, the northern is the sea, except
                where a really artificial boundary runs through Jutland.</p>
                            <p>In the east of Germany and the north-east of Austria the winding frontier through
                low plains is the result of the partition of Poland, but in spite of the absence of
                marked physical features it is for the most part in its details almost as typical as
                the mountainous frontier on the south of Germany. All the great rivers are crossed.
                Most of the line runs through a tract of strikingly scanty population, and the dense
                population in one part of it, where upper Silesia confines with Russian Poland, has
                been developed since the boundary was fixed.</p>
                            <p>In the Balkan Peninsula the most striking facts are that the Balkans do not, and
                the Danube to a large extent does form a boundary. Geographical features, however,
                bring the valley of the Maritsa (eastern Rumelia) into intimate relation with upper
                Bulgaria, the connexion of which with Bulgaria north of the Balkans had long been
                established by the valley of the Isker, narrow as that valley is. On the side of
                Rumania, again, it is the marshes on the left bank of the Danube even more than the
                river itself that make of that river a frontier. An examination of the eastern
                boundary of all that is included in Russia in Europe will furnish further
                illustrations of the general rule.</p>
                            <p>Finally, on the north-west of Russia it was only natural that the Tornea and the
                Tana should be taken as lines of demarcation in that thinly peopled region, and it
                was equally natural that where the <table rows="31" cols="6">

                            <p>The origin of the name of Europe has been dealt with above, and the difficulty of
                any exact definition of the geographical limits covered by this term has been
                pointed out. A similar difficulty meets us when we come to deal with European
                history. We know what we mean when we speak of European civilization, though in its
                origins, as in its modern developments, this was not confined to Europe. In one
                sense the history of Europe is the history of this civilization and of the forces by
                which it was produced, preserved and developed; for a separate history of Europe
                could never have been written but for the alien powers by which this civilization
                was for centuries confined within the geographical limits of the European continent.
                Moreover, within these geographical limits the tradition of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name>, and above
                all the organization of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Catholic
                Church</name>, gave to the European nations, and the states based upon them, a
                homogeneity which without them could not have survived. The name of Europe, indeed,
                remained until modern times no more than <q>" a geographical expression "</q> ; its
                diplomatic use, in the sense of a group of states having common interests and
                duties, is, indeed, no older than the 19th century ; in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> its place was
                taken by the conceptions of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Church">the Church</name> and the
                Empire, which, though theoretically universal, were practically European. Yet the
                history of the states system of Europe, though enormously influenced by outside
                forces, possesses from the first a character of its own, which enables it to be
                treated as a separate unit. This historical Europe, however, has never been exactly
                commensurate with Europe considered as a geographical division. Russia, though part
                of Europe geographically—even if we set the limits of Asia at the Don with certain
                old geographers —had but slight influence on European history until the time of
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_I_of_Russia">Peter the
                  Great</name>. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">The Ottoman empire</name>, though
                its influence on the affairs of Europe was from the first profound, was essentially
                an Asiatic power, and was not formally introduced into the European system until
                  <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Paris_(1856)">the treaty of
                  Paris of 1856</title>. It still remains outside European civilization.</p>
                            <p>Europe, then, as we now conceive the term in its application to the political
                system and the type of culture established in this part of the world, may, broadly
                speaking, be traced to four principal origins : <list>
                                    <item>(1) The Aegean civilization (Hellenic and pre- Hellenic);</item>
                                    <item>(2) <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> ;</item>
                                    <item>(3) Christianity ;</item>
                                    <item>(4) the break-up of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> by the
                    Teutonic invasions</item>
                                </list>. All these forces helped in the development of Europe as we now know it. To
                the Aegean civilization, whether transformed by contact with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>, and again transformed
                by the influence of Christianity and the religious genius of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>—or
                rediscovered during the classical <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">Renaissance</name>—Europe owes the
                characteristic qualities of its thought and of its expression in literature and art.
                From republican <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> it largely draws its conceptions of law and of administrative order.
                From <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the
                  Roman Empire</name> it inherited a tradition of political unity which survived, in
                visible form, though but as a shadowy symbol, until <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">the last Holy
                  Roman emperor</name> abdicated in 1806 ; survived also, more fruitfully, in the
                rules of the Roman lawyers which developed into modern international law. Yet more
                does Europe owe to Christianity, an Asiatic religion, but modified by contact with
                Greek thought and powerfully organized on the lines of the Roman administrative
                system. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Church">The Roman Church</name> remained a reality when <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> had become
                little more than a name, and was throughout the period of chaos and transformation
                that followed the collapse of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> the most
                powerful instrument for giving to the heterogeneous races of Europe a common culture
                and a certain sense of common interests.</p>
                            <p>The history of Europe, then, might well begin with the origins of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> and
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>, and
                trace the rise of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> and the
                successive influence upon it of Hellenism and Christianity. These subjects are,
                however, very fully dealt with elsewhere (see AEGEAN CIVILIZATION ; GREECE ; ROME ;
                CHURCH HISTORY) ; and it will, therefore, be more convenient to begin this account
                with the Teutonic invasions and the break-up of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name>, events
                which mark the definite beginning of the modern European states system.</p>
                            <p>In a sense <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> had been already <q>" barbarized "</q> before the
                invasions of the barbarians <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                                    <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>
                                </foreign>. Land left vacant by the dwindling of the population was colonized by
                immigrants, Teutonic and other, from beyond the frontiers ; the Roman legions were
                largely recruited from <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_peoples">Germans</name> and other non-
                Romans, some of whom even rose to the imperial purple. Thus, in the end, the Roman
                emperor, with his guard and his household, ruling over an empire mercilessly
                exploited to fill his treasury, was essentially indistinguishable from those
                barbarian chiefs, with their antrustions and their primitive fiscal methods, who
                entered into portions of his inheritance and carried on the traditions of his

                prior to their organized invasions of the empire is dealt with elsewhere (see
                TEUTONIC PEOPLES). It was in the 4th century that the pressure of their advance was
                first felt on the frontiers, and this led to a change in the government of the
                empire which was to have notable consequences. In A.D. 330 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantine_I">Constantine</name> had transferred

                continued to be administered successfully from a single centre. Not, however, for
                long: the increasing perils from without made a closer supervision essential, and

                and changes took place which led to the rise of independent <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_peoples">Teutonic</name> kingdoms in
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul">Gaul</name> and Spain.
                In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul">Gaul</name>

                kingdom, with its capital at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toledo,_Spain">Toledo</name>, now asserted its
                  <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_peoples">Teutonic</name> independence. Under the emperor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Justinian_I">Justinian</name> (527-565), indeed,

                Africa was destroyed; in 555 the Byzantine general <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Narses">Narses</name> finally shattered the power

                were forced to give up the south of Spain; and the Persians were checked. But with

In 568 <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lombards">the Lombards</name>, under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alboin">Alboin</name>, appeared in
                Italy, which they overran as far south as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiber">the Tiber</name>, establishing their
                kingdom on the ruins of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exarchate_of_Ravenna">the exarchate</name>.
                Though in Asia <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraclius">the
                  emperor Heraclius</name>, in a series of victorious campaigns, broke the Persian

                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ravenna">Ravenna</name> itself
                and a few scattered sea-coast towns, was thenceforth lost to the empire of which in
                theory it still formed a part.</p>
                            <p>This catastrophe produced one result the importance of which it is impossible to
                exaggerate : the development of the political power of <name type="institution">the
                  papacy</name>. At the beginning of the 6th century <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome">Rome</name>, under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodoric_the_Great">Theodoric the Goth</name>,
                was still the city of the Caesars, the tradition of its ancient life was yet

                (590-604), had become the city of the popes. And with the city the popes entered
                into some of the inheritance of the Caesars; in the world-wide activity of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_I">Gregory</name> we
                already have a foreshadowing of universal claims, often effectively asserted, which
                made the great medieval popes, in a truer sense than the medieval emperors, the

The full force of the
                militant religion founded by the Arab prophet was not felt till after his death
                (632). <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraclius">The emperor

                fanaticism, and aided by the treason and cowardice of the decadent Roman governing
                classes, overran Asia Minor, conquered Egypt and the whole of northern Africa,
                overwhelmed the Gothic kingdom in Spain, and even penetrated beyond the Pyrenees to

                landowners had successfully asserted their independence of the jurisdiction of the

                territorial nobles to whom, amid the growing anarchy, men looked for protection
                rather than to the weak and remote central power; and so, out of the chaos that

                feudal system of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> (see FEUDALISM). This organization was admirable for
                defence; and with its aid, before the close of the first decade of the 10th century,
                the frontiers of France and Germany had been made safe against the northern
                barbarians, who had either been driven off and barriers erected against their
                return—e.g. the marks established by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_the_Fowler">Henry the Fowler</name> along

                            <p>Feudalism, by the time the Northmen had been subdued by its aid, was quite firmly
                established in the western part of Europe. During the 11th century it was carried by
                  <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Normans">the Normans</name>
                into England, into Sicily and southern Italy, and by the nobles of the first crusade
                into the newly established <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem">kingdom of Jerusalem</name>
                (1099). By the kings of France, England and Germany, however, who saw themselves in
                danger of being stripped of all but the semblance of power by its delegation to
                their more or less nominal vassals, the feudal organization was early recognized as
                impossible as a form of state government, if the state was to be preserved ; and the
                history of the three great European powers during the succeeding centuries is mainly
                that of the struggle of the sovereigns against the disruptive ambitions of the great
                feudal nobles. In England the problem was, from the outset, simplified; for though
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_I_of_England">William
                  the Conqueror</name> introduced the system of feudal land tenure into England in
                1066 he refused to set it up as his system of government, retaining alongside of it
                the old English national policy. In France, on the other hand, feudalism as a system
                of government had become firmly established; and it was not till the days of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France">Philip
                  Augustus</name> (1180-1223) and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_IX_of_France">Louis IX.</name> (1226-1270)
                that the monarchy began to get the upper hand. From this time until the 17th century
                the power of the French monarchy, in spite of occasional lapses, grew steadily
                stronger. The reverse was the case with the German kingship. Its association with
                the undefined claims involved in the title of Roman emperor, traditionally attached
                to it, and notably those to authority in Italy, necessitated concession after
                concession to the feudal nobles, in order to purchase their support for their
                assertion. The kingship, moreover, became elective; the imperial title was
                obtainable only at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome">Rome</name> at the hands of the pope; and the German kings thus became entangled
                in contests, not only with their own vassals, but with the tremendous spiritual
                force of the medieval <name type="institution">papacy</name> by which, for its own
                ends, the spirit of feudal insubordination was from time to time fomented. Thus in
                Germany the feudal nobles gradually acquired a sovereign status which, in some
                cases, has survived the territorial rearrangements of the 19th century and left its
                mark on the federal constitution of modern Germany ; while the kingship and the
                imperial title grew more and more shadowy till in 1806 it vanished altogether. (See

                (1039-1056) governed Germany wisely, and his reign witnessed the culminating point

                  Holy Roman Empire</name>. At the time of his death it seemed probable that
                Germany, like England and France, would gradually escape from the thraldom of the
                great feudatories. The future of the German monarchy depended upon the ability of
                future kings to suppress the forces of feudal disintegration in Germany, and to

                reached a high pitch and made itself felt in the crusading movement, which received

                            <p>With the era of the Crusades, which lasted till the middle ot the 13th century,
                Europe entered upon a period of change, the importance of which is realized by
                contrasting the condition of western Christendom in the 11th with its condition in
                the 13th century. Between the opening and close of the crusading movement Europe
                underwent a complete revolution. While the <pb n="926" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0926.png"/> Crusades tended to enhance the
                prestige and authority of <name type="institution">the papacy</name> and the power
                of European monarchs, they also led to increased knowledge of the East, to the rapid
                development of commerce; to the introduction of new industries, to the rapid decline
                of the influence of the feudal nobility, and to the rapid development of town life
                (see COMMUNE). At the same time the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_VII">Hildebrandine</name>
                reformation was having an immense influence upon the intellectual condition of
                Europe. The 12th century saw the establishment of many new monastic orders (see
                MONASTICISM), and at the same time a remarkable speculative and literary revival
                (see SCHOLASTICISM). This movement owed not a little of its success to the influence
                of the Crusades, which stirred up intellectual as well as commercial activity. This
                intellectual activity, as well as the fruits of commercial expansion, were— since
                learning was still a monopoly of the clerical order—weapons in the hands of <name type="institution">the papacy</name>, which in the 12th century attained the
                height of its power, if not of its pretensions. It is, indeed, impossible to
                exaggerate the influence of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Church</name>
                upon the development of Europe at this period. The popes, in fact, represented
                Europe in a sense that could not be predicated of the emperors ; the terror of their
                spiritual power, their vast wealth derived from the tribute of all the West, their
                unique experience of international affairs, and—in the case of the great popes of
                this epoch—the superiority of their minds and characters, made them not only the
                spiritual rulers of Europe, but the effective centres of whatever political unity it
                possessed. As a Byzantine observer was to observe of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Innocent_III">Innocent III.</name>, they had
                become the successors of the Caesars rather than of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Peter">Peter</name> (see PAPACY).</p>

                            <p>The rest of Europe was also in various degrees affected by the Crusades. While
                Spain was occupied in a crusade of her own against the Moors and gradually driving
                them into <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granada">Granada</name>, Germany, Italy, and to some extent England, were interested in,
                and influenced by, the Crusades against the Turks. During the absence of many of the
                nobles in the East the growth of towns and the development of the mercantile class
                proceeded without interruption. The trading classes demanded strong governments and
                equal justice, and vigorously supported the monarchs in their suppression of
                feudalism.</p>
                            <p>During the 12th and 13th centuries the Crusades thus proved a large factor in the
                commercial prosperity of the Italian maritime states, an <q>" open door "</q>
                between East and West was secured, and reinforcements from Europe were poured into
                Syria as long as the peoples of the West regarded the stability of <name type="institution">the Latin kingdom of Syria</name> as a matter of prime
                importance. During the crusading period a check was placed to the tide of Mahommedan
                conquest, while to <name type="institution">the caliphate</name> the Crusades proved
                a perpetual drain upon its material resources. To the Mahommedans the possession of
                  <name type="place">the Holy Places</name> by the Christians was as great a
                humiliation as their desecration by the Mahommedans was to the crusaders.
                Unfortunately the Crusades led to a disastrous schism between <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire">the
                  Byzantine empire</name> and western Christendom, which had calamitous results. The
                decay of the crusading spirit was a necessary result of the growth of the
                consolidation of the European nations, but the price paid was the fall of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> and the establishment of the Turks in eastern Europe. The
                Crusades thus not only postponed the conquest of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> by the
                Turks for some two hundred years, but led, as has already been said, to a vast
                expansion of commerce, as seen in the rapid growth and development of the Italian
                cities, and to a striking development of town life.</p>

                the spirit of nationalism and particularism. England, France and Spain were rapidly

                firm basis. In spite of the intellectual activity and political developments which

                years to come the dread of Ottoman aggression was a dominant factor in the politics

                national sentiment, as exemplified in the career of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joan_of_Arc">Joan of Arc</name> (q.v.), was
                developed ; an alliance, essential for the successful expulsion of the English from
                France, was made in 1435 between <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_VII_of_France">the king of France</name>
                and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_the_Good">the duke
                  of Burgundy</name> ; and in 1439 the famous <title>ordinance</title> empowering
                the king to maintain a standing army and to raise money for its maintenance was

                These measures proved successful; in 1453 the Hundred Years' War came to an end, and

                (1483-1498), <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brittany">Brittany</name> was annexed, and France, secure from all danger of a feudal

                modern times. A similar process is observable in England and Spain. In England the
                Wars of the Roses were followed by the establishment of a strong monarchy under
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_VII_of_England">Henry

                their reign suppressed all attempts at provincial independence. In 1491 the
                consolidation of Spain was completed by the conquest of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granada">Granada</name>. In 1397, by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kalmar_Union">the union of Calmar</title>, the

                            <p>During the whole of the 15th century Europe had been affected by what is known as
                the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">Renaissance</name> movement, which marked the transition from the medieval to the
                modern order. This movement, caused by the growth of learning, had its first home in
                Italy, which had witnessed a marvellous revival of interest in classical antiquity,
                in painting and in sculpture, accompanied by a keen intellectual activity in
                religious and political, no less than in literary matters. Criticism of existing
                beliefs was developed, knowledge became widely diffused, and, while the way was
                prepared for the substitution of individualism for the old ecclesiastical system,
                the development of commerce coincident with the discovery of America and the
                establishment of monarchical systems destroyed feudalism (see RENAISSANCE). The
                later years of the 15th, and the early years of the 16th, centuries may be described
                as the transition from medievalism to modern times, from feudalism to individualism,
                from the idea of a world church and a world empire to one in which national
                consolidation was the chief feature and monarchical government a necessity.</p>

                            <p>From the beginning of the 16th century Europe entered upon modern times. Many
                events marked the close of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. The
                discovery of America, the decay of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Venice">Venice</name>, the
                development of the European states system, the rise of diplomacy as a permanent
                international system (see DIPLOMACY), the wars of religion—all these are the general
                characteristics of the new period upon which Europe now enters. With the growth of
                monarchies arises the belief in the divine right of kings, the development of
                territorial sovereignty, and wars of ambition like those waged by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis

                            <p>The advent of the Reformation, as has already been pointed out, finally shattered
                that ideal of civil and religious unity which had been the main characteristic of
                  <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
                  ages</name>. Thus from the beginning of the 16th century Europe sees the
                development of the modern states system and becomes the scene of national wars in
                which the idea of the balance of power was the leading principle (see BALANCE OF
                POWER). That principle did not allow of the recognition of the rights of
                nationalities, and till the wars of the French Revolution the interests of the
                various European states were usually subordinated to the dynastic aims of their
                rulers. During the ensuing centuries the balance of power in Europe was seriously
                threatened ; during the first half of the 16th century by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Charles V.</name>,

                            <p>The close of the Seven Years' War seemed to prelude a period of British ascendancy
                on the continent, but that danger passed away with the outbreak of the war between
                Great Britain and her American colonies. For a time the balance of power in Europe
                was completely shattered by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s brilliant
                conquests, but his fall, while to a great extent restoring the political

                to dominate Europe. Thus the 16th century definitely marked the beginning of modern

                enabled to turn their attention to the issues raised by the immense growth of
                Protestantism since 1521. While <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Charles V.</name>
                had been engaged in his struggles with the Turks and the French, Protestantism had

                still to be counted with. From the middle of the 16th century the growth of

                lead among European Catholic monarchs in working for the extinction of
                Protestantism. His recovery of the southern Netherlands for the Catholic cause, his
                attempt to conquer England, his intention of subjugating France, were all parts of a
                scheme to advance simultaneously his own power and that of the

                in winning back large portions of Europe to allegiance to <name type="institution">the papacy</name>. But failure attended most of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_Spain">Philip</name>'s projects.
                Though he succeeded in recovering the southern or <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wallonia">Walloon</name> provinces of the
                Netherlands, he was unable to conquer the northern provinces, which under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_the_Silent">William of

                failed, and the Spanish Armada was totally defeated in 1588. Nor was his plan for
                the subjection of France more successful. After a tedious civil war between the
                Catholics and Huguenots, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_IV_of_France">Henry of Navarre</name>
                appeared as a national leader, who, having overcome the armies of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catholic_League_(French)">the

                proved an admirable opportunity for the entry of France into the Thirty Years' War.
                And till 1648, in spite of occasional reverses, the French and their allies
                gradually wore down their adversaries. After the death of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_IV_of_France">Henry IV.</name> in 1610
                France had temporarily retired from a foremost place in the politics of Europe, and
                for some thirty years her ministers were busy in coercing the Huguenots and
                establishing the supremacy of the crown which was threatened by the nobles. Once
                united at home France was ready and eager to seize the opportunity for inflicting a
                severe blow upon <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Habsburg">the Habsburgs</name> in Spain
                and Austria. The time for such action was well chosen. Austria was weakened by the
                war which had been waged since 1618, while Spain, exhausted by her efforts in the
                preceding century, had entered upon a long period of decay, and was about to see
                Portugal regain its independence. The Protestant princes in the north of Germany
                were ready to ally with France and Sweden against the emperor, even the Catholic
                Bavarian duke was to prove a doubtful ally of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Habsburg">the Habsburg house</name>. In
                1642 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_Richelieu">Richelieu</name> and in 1643 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIII_of_France">Louis XIII.</name> died,
                but though <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis XIV.</name> was an infant, and the French nobles by their cabals hindered
                the work of the regency, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_Mazarin">Mazarin</name> successfully
                carried out the anti-Habsburg policy of his predecessors and brought the war against

                establish a monarchical system throughout all Germany. By that peace the practical
                independence of the German princes was assured. Henceforward each prince could
                decide what form of religion was to be observed in his dominions. Thus Lutheranism,
                Calvinism and Catholicism were alike tolerated, and this recognition of the
                principle of compromise prepared the way for a wider toleration. Moreover, the petty

                numbered over 300, were allowed the right of concluding alliances with any foreign
                power, of making their own laws, and of carrying on war. Thus, in consequence of

                cohesion and became little more than a confederation. The states had firmly

                France, Spain found itself also involved in hostilities with England, and the real
                rottenness of the Spanish monarchy became rapidly apparent. Any assistance which
                might have been hoped for from the emperor was prevented by the formation of leagues
                of German princes—lay and ecclesiastical—in 1657 and 1658, which had the full
                support of France. The effect of the formation of the second league was at once
                apparent: all hope of assistance to Spain from the emperor was seen to have
                disappeared, and the conclusion of a pacific settlement between France and Spain was
                at once arrived at. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_the_Pyrenees">The peace of the Pyrenees</title> was a triumph for the <name type="institution">

                in France the Fronde was holding its own against <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_Mazarin">Mazarin</name>; in Germany the
                princes had triumphed over the emperor ; even in Russia the nobles were aiming at
                the curtailment of the power of the crown. But from 1660 it became evident that
                these attempts to secure the curtailment of the monarchical power were, with few
                exceptions, not destined to be successful. Though all chance of the establishment of
                a strong central authority in Germany had disappeared, the various states composing
                  <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the
                  Empire</name> now entered upon a new period in their history and speedily formed

                made his crown hereditary, and his establishment of an absolutism was imitated by

                            <p>During his reign France took the lead in European politics, and established her
                supremacy all the more easily, owing partly to the weakness of most of the European
                countries, partly to the aggressions of the Turks, whose invasions of eastern Europe
                occupied from 1683 to 1699 the attention of the Poles and of the Austrians. The
                weakness or neutrality of the various European states was due to various causes.
                England was prevented till 1689 from taking a part in opposing the ambitious schemes

                could do nothing to resist the growing ascendancy of France, owing to the increasing
                weakness and rapid decadence of Spain, whose disappearance from the rank of great
                powers was one of the most striking features in the history of Europe during the
                second half of the 17th century. The weakness of Germany from <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Westphalia">the peace of

                            <p>Realizing the strength of his own position and the weakness of that of most of the
                European states, he entered in 1667 into the Devolution war and secured several
                fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands. From 1672 to 1678 he was again at war with
                Holland, and from 1673 with the emperor, Spain and Brandenburg as well. At the same
                time the Turks invaded Poland, but were successfully resisted by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_III_Sobieski">John Sobieski</name>. In 1676,
                however, they made the favourable <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Żurawno">treaty of Żurawna</title>,
                securing <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kamianets-Podilskyi">Kamenets</name> and portions of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Podolia">Podolia</name> and the Ukraine. Thus,
                while the Turks were threatening the independence of eastern Europe, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis
                  XIV.</name> was attacking the independence of western Europe. In 1678 he made
                  <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaties_of_Nijmegen">the treaty of
                  Nijmwegen</title>, securing great advantages for France. Till the end of the
                century Europe was faced with two serious problems : Could she successfully cope
                with the Turks on her eastern frontier? And could she resist the continued
                aggressions of France on her western frontier ? Consequently the years from 1678 to
                the end of the century were of vital importance to the European world. For during
                that period the French and the Turks made unceasing efforts to extend their
                frontiers at the expense of Germany. Encouraged by the weakness of the chief
                European states, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name> set up <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chambers_of_Reunion">the
                  Chambers of Reunion</name>, seized <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strasbourg">Strassburg</name> in time of peace
                and attempted to annex Luxemburg. At the same time it seemed that an independent
                Gallican Church would be set up, and that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name>, like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry
                  VIII.</name>, would sever all connexion with Rome. The persecution of the
                Jansenists and the revocation of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edict_of_Nantes">the edict of Nantes</title> in
                1685 established something akin to religious uniformity in France. Buoyed up by his
                successes abroad and at home, and conscious that he had nothing to fear from England
                or from Spain, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name> prepared to
                carry out his schemes, with regard to the extension of his territory eastwards, at
                the expense of Germany. Simultaneously with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name>' aggressions in
                western Europe, the Turks had made an attempt to capture <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name> in 1683. Fortunately the
                efforts of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopold_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">the emperor
                  Leopold</name>, aided by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_III_Sobieski">John Sobieski</name>, king of
                Poland, were successful, and the Turkish tide of conquest was gradually but
                successfully checked. It was not, however, till the accession of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_III_of_England">William III.</name> to
                the English throne that the tide of French conquest in western Europe was in like
                manner successfully resisted, and it was not till <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Ryswick">the treaty of Ryswick</title>
                in 1697 that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name> realized that
                Europe had set a limit to his conquests. That treaty inflicted a blow on the
                prestige of France, just as <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Karlowitz">the treaty of
                  Karlowitz</title>, concluded in 1699, was an important step in the decline of the
                Ottoman power. By that treaty, which marks a definite beginning in the history of
                the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the hands of the emperor were freed, and he was able
                to devote his attention to the Spanish succession question, which already engrossed
                the attention of all Europe.</p>

                  treaty</title>. However, on the death of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_II_of_Spain">King Charles</name> on the
                1st of November 1700 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name> repudiated the

                became <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_V_of_Spain">Philip V. of Spain</name>. Not content with this success <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name> committed a
                number of aggressive acts which led to the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702.
                That war continued till 1713, when <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Utrecht">the treaty of Utrecht</title>,
                followed in 1714 by the treaties of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Rastatt">Rastadt</title> and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Baden">Baden</title>, ended a struggle
                which had many results of vital importance to Europe. Great Britain, strengthened by
                the possession of Gibraltar and Minorca, by her establishment in Canada, and by
                trading rights in South America, henceforward stood forth as a rising colonial power
                to whom the command of the sea was essential. Austria obtained not only Belgium,
                which she held till the French Revolution, but also a firm foothold in Italy, which
                she maintained till 1859. To Spain the war indirectly brought unexpected benefits.
                Freed from her expensive possessions in Belgium and Italy, and now ruled by a new
                dynasty, Spain, so far from meeting with the fate which later attended Poland,
                entered upon a new period in her career, and throughout the 18th century showed
                considerable power of resistance to the colonial policy of Great Britain.</p>

                            <p>Before many years had passed after <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Utrecht">the treaty of Utrecht</title>
                it became evident that two new nations were forcing themselves into the front rank
                of European powers. These were European Russia and Prussia. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Nystad">The treaty of Nystäd</title> in
                1721 to the north of Europe what <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Utrecht">the treaty of Utrecht</title>
                was to the western and southern nations. It marked the decline of Sweden and the
                rise of Russia, which henceforth played an important part in European politics.
                Nevertheless till 1740, with the exception of the short Polish Succession War
                1733-35 and the equally short war of 1737-39, in which Russia and Austria fought
                against Turkey, no general European struggle took place. That this was so was due in
                great measure to the alliance of 1717 between Great Britain and France, to the
                subsequent peace policy upheld by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Walpole">Walpole</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/André-Hercule_de_Fleury">Fleury</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/José_Patiño">Patiño</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arvid_Horn">Horn</name> (the English, French,

                  Vienna</title> in 1725—and to the uncertain character of Russian politics.</p>
                            <p>During those years from 1713 to 1740 the great powers were slowly forming
                themselves into groups, bound together by motives of interest. Thus Spain and France
                after 1729 began to realize that both countries were interested in checking Great
                Britain's colonial developments, while Spain was also ready to seize every
                opportunity of increasing her possessions in Italy at the expense of Austria.</p>

                            <p>With the year 1740 Europe entered upon a new epoch. The rivalry of Austria and
                Prussia for the leadership of Germany definitely began, and the struggle between

                acute phase. The War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48) holds therefore an
                important place in the history of Europe, and proved with the Seven Years' War,
                which was practically a continuation of it, of very real interest to Europe.</p>

                  treaty</title> lies in the fact that they indicate not only the lines followed by
                later European settlements, but also the tendency of later European developments. To

                  treaty</title> was only a pause in her expansion in Canada and in her advance to

                            <p>The Seven Years' War (1756-63) opened with a diplomatic revolution as important as
                that of 1717, when France and Great Britain made an alliance. In May 1756, as a
                reply to <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Westminster_(1756)">the
                  treaty of Westminster the Second</title>, made in January between Great Britain
                and Prussia, France and Austria united in <title>the treaty of Versailles</title>.
                This unexpected union, which lasted till the French Revolution, between two powers
                which had been hostile to each other from the beginning of the 16th century, amazed
                all Europe. However, it had not the results expected, for although Russia, which was
                allied with Austria, sent large armies headed by capable generals to the war, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_II_of_Prussia">Frederick
                  the Great</name> remained unconquered. This result was partly due to the English
                alliance, partly to the incapable French generals, and partly to the state of
                internal politics in Russia. The treaties of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)">Paris (February 10,
                  1763)</title> and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Hubertusburg">Hubertsburg (February 15)</title> marked an important stage in the history of
                Europe. By the first Great Britain emerged from the war an imperial power with
                possessions all over the world, by the second Prussia was recognized as the equal of
                Austria in Europe.</p>

                            <p>No sooner was the Seven Years' War ended than France and Spain, having made the
                third <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacte_de_Famille">family
                  compact</title> in 1761 (the other two were signed in 1733 and 1743), prepared to
                take revenge upon Great Britain at the first favourable opportunity. The result of
                this determination, and of Great Britain's absorption in internal politics, was that
                Russia, Prussia and Austria were enabled to carry out the first partition of Poland
                in 1772. The entry of France into the American war of independence rendered it
                impossible for <name type="person" key="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph
                  II.</name>, single-handed, to carry out his project of exchanging the Austrian
                Netherlands for <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bavaria">Bavaria</name>, and he was compelled, after a short war, to give up for the time

                (1779). The continuance of the American War proved of great value to Russia and
                enhanced her position in Europe. Not only had she, together with France, brought
                about <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Teschen">the treaty of
                  Teschen</title>, but in 1780 she headed <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_League_of_Armed_Neutrality">the league of
                  armed neutrality</title>, and between 1780 and 1784 annexed <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crimea">the Crimea</name>. The conclusion of the
                war of American Independence enabled Great Britain to regain her influence in
                Europe, and when Russia and Austria combined to attack Turkey, and when France
                threatened to re-establish her influence in Holland, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name> formed with
                the Prussian king and the stadtholder the famous <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1788)">Triple Alliance of
                  1788</name>. During the ensuing four years the influence of that alliance made
                itself felt in an unmistakable way. All hope of the establishment of French
                influence in Holland was destroyed; Denmark was forced to relinquish an attack on
                Sweden, then at war with Russia ; and after <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopold_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Leopold of
                  Tuscany</name> had succeeded <name type="person" key="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II.</name> as emperor in 1790, the
                revolution in the Netherlands was brought to an end. Moreover, through the influence

                the hostility of Prussia to Austria was removed, and the two powers in July 1790
                made <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Reichenbach_(1790)">the
                  treaty of Reichenbach</title>. Great Britain, the chief member of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1788)">the
                  Triple Alliance</name>, had supported the pacific solution of all these questions
                so menacing to European peace, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name> was aided
                in his policy by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopold_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">the emperor

                with the Turks. Danger to the peace of Europe was, however, caused by the attempt of

                            <p>Instead of Europe remaining at peace the year 1792 saw the beginning of a series of
                wars which did not come to a final conclusion till the battle of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Waterloo,_Belgium">Waterloo</name>. While the
                east of Europe was engaged in war, and while <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1788)">the Triple
                  Alliance</name> was busy attempting to restore peace to Europe, the French
                Revolution had broken out in 1789. The assistance given by France to the American
                colonists had brought the country to bankruptcy, and no course was left to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XVI_of_France">Louis
                  XVI.</name> except to summon <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_States-General">the states-general</name>
                in May 1789. In that year a revolution against the reforms of <name type="person" key="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II.</name> had taken place in the
                Netherlands, and a revolution was being prepared in Poland for the overthrow of the
                aristocratic constitution and for the establishment of an hereditary monarchy. At
                first the revolution in France was entirely occupied with internal reforms, but
                after the dissolution of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Constituent_Assembly">the Constituent
                  Assembly</name> in September 1791 the Girondists, whose influence became
                paramount, determined by the advice of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacques_Pierre_Brissot">Brissot</name> to insist
                upon a policy of menace towards <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Empire</name> which would
                inevitably lead to war. War would, they hoped, result in the downfall of monarchy in
                France. On the other hand, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gilbert_du_Motier,_marquis_de_Lafayette">Lafayette</name> and his party advocated war on the ground that it would
                strengthen the cause of monarchy. In April 1792 war was accordingly declared upon
                Austria, then in alliance with Prussia. After a short period of failure the French
                in September won the battle of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valmy">Valmy</name>, and in November the battle
                of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jemappes">Jemappes</name>.
                French armies advanced to the Rhine, Belgium was occupied, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scheldt">the Scheldt</name> was declared open,
                and Holland was threatened. In consequence of the danger to Holland, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name> adopted a warlike tone, and in February 1793 France declared war upon
                Great Britain. In that war Spain, Sardinia and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuscany">Tuscany</name> joined, so that France
                was practically fighting all Europe. Nevertheless, owing to the want of union among
                the allies, to the Polish questions which distracted Prussia and Austria, and to the
                determination and patriotism of all classes in France, the allies were discomfited
                and the league of powers broken up in 1795, when <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Basel">the treaties of Basel</title>
                were made. Only Great Britain, Austria and Sardinia remained in arms against France,
                which was till 1799 ruled by <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Directory">the Directory</name>. The next
                few years witnessed a series of most startling events. The successes of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon
                  Bonaparte</name> in the Italian campaigns of 1797 and 1798 led to <title>the peace

                  Formio</title> with Austria. Only Great Britain remained at war with France. In
                1799, taking advantage of the absence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> in Egypt,
                  <title>the Second treaties of Coalition</title> was formed by Russia, Great
                Britain and Austria. Though the French were driven from Italy, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/André_Masséna">Masséna</name> defeated the
                Russians in Switzerland, and the English were forced to retire from Holland. The
                return of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> from Egypt was followed by the establishment of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Consulate">the

                            <p>Up to this point the Revolution may be said to have benefited Europe and to have
                shaken to its base the 18th-century ideas of government. During the years succeeding
                  <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Campo_Formio">the peace of Campo
                  Formio</title> a revolution was effected in Germany. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">The Holy Roman Empire</name>
                had become an anachronism, and as soon as France became possessed of the left bank
                of the Rhine it was obvious that the imperial constitution required revision. The
                jealousies existing among the German princes and the overthrow of Austria at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slavkov_u_Brna">Austerlitz</name>
                enabled <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> to carry out a revolution in Germany according to his own ideas.
                At first, in 1804, new arrangements were made with regard to the character and
                formation of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichstag_(institution)">the diet</name>. The
                constitution of that assembly was so altered that a Protestant majority free from
                Austrian influence was now assured. The middle states, such as Prussia, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baden">Baden</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bavaria">Bavaria</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Württemberg">Württemberg</name> and
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanover">Hanover</name>
                received additions of territory, taken either from the ecclesiastical states or from
                the lands belonging to the imperial knights. After <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slavkov_u_Brna">Austerlitz</name>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> in 1806 established <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confederation_of_the_Rhine">the Confederation of

                came finally to an end. A great European revolution had been now effected, but much
                remained to be done before a feeling of nationality could be aroused among the
                people of central Europe.</p>

                            <p>Already before <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Amiens">the peace
                  of Amiens</title>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name> had tried to stir up national feeling in Austria and Prussia, the
                means which he suggested for opposing <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> being in
                great measure those which were adopted in 1813 and 1814. But during <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name>'s lifetime central Europe was not moved by any feeling of nationality
                or of patriotism. During the war of the Second Coalition in 1799 Austria had acted
                without any regard for her allies, while Prussia, from motives of jealousy of and
                from want of confidence in Austria, had refused to move. It was not till the small
                states which hitherto had formed independent units had been destroyed and Austria
                and Prussia trampled under foot by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> that a
                strong national spirit in Germany was evoked. Until <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaties_of_Tilsit">the treaty of Tilsit</title>
                had been signed in 1807 there was no visible growth of a national uprising in any
                part of Europe. During the intervening years Prussia had been crushed at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jena">Jena</name> and her kingdom
                cut short (1806), while <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">Alexander I. of
                  Russia</name>, after a fierce campaign against <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>, had agreed
                in 1807 to <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaties_of_Tilsit">the treaty of
                  Tilsit</title>, which apparently placed Europe at the feet of France and Russia.
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> was, as he thought, now in a position to bring about the
                humiliation of Great Britain. Already in November 1806, realizing that he could not
                ruin England by direct invasion, he had issued the first <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin_Decree">Berlin Decree</title>, which
                ordered the exclusion of British goods from the continent. The Continental System
                necessitated by the victory of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cape_Trafalgar">Trafalgar</name> was thus
                definitely set up. After <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sovetsk,_Kaliningrad_Oblast">Tilsit</name> he
                proposed to become supreme in the Baltic, and, by securing the dependence of Spain
                and Portugal, to dominate the Mediterranean, and to resume his plans for conquests
                in the East, and for the destruction of the British power in India. Thus the effects
                of the British naval victories of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abu_Qir_Bay">the Nile</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cape_Trafalgar">Trafalgar</name>
                would be completely nullified, the Mediterranean would be closed to British ships,
                Great Britain's Indian possessions would be lost, and Great Britain herself would be
                forced by starvation into surrender. Fortunately for Europe various circumstances
                hindered the realization of these ambitious schemes. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">Alexander</name>, who
                feared that the French emperor desired <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name>, never
                proved a very helpful ally, the measures taken by Great Britain seriously interfered
                with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s schemes, and, before he had subjugated Spain, first Austria in
                1809 and then Russia in 1812 offered an active resistance to his projects. The first
                note of opposition to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s plans was
                struck by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Canning">Canning</name>, when in 1807 he carried off the Danish fleet to England. Then the
                British fleet conveyed to Brazil in safety the Portuguese royal family when Portugal
                was invaded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Andoche_Junot">Junot</name>, while the
                surrender of 30,000 French troops at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailén">Baylen</name> in July 1808, which was
                followed in August by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Convention_of_Sintra">the convention of Cintra</title>, indicated that Spanish patriotism was, when
                roused, as effective as in the days of the Spanish Succession War. Austria was the
                first country to follow the example of Spain, and though she was defeated at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deutsch-Wagram">Wagram</name> and
                forced to accept <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s hard
                terms, the national feeling aroused in Germany in 1809 rapidly developed. But <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> was apparently unconscious of the growth and importance of a
                national sentiment in any of the subject countries. In 1810 he had married <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marie_Louise,_Duchess_of_Parma">Marie Louise of Austria</name>, on the 20th of March 1811 a son was born to him,
                and he now seems to have resolved upon the establishment of a strictly hereditary
                empire with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>
                its capital and Rome its second city. In extent, his empire would be vaster than
                that of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name>, and the pope was to be completely subordinate to the emperor.
                This conception of the establishment of a reformed <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">Holy Roman Empire</name> with
                its centre at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> did not appear unrealizable in 1811 when everything seemed to favour
                the new <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s power was
                apparently securely established, and during the years 1810 and 1811 he was again
                returning to his vast oriental designs. A sudden check, however, was about to be
                placed upon his ambitious schemes.</p>

                ignoring the strength of the Spanish resistance, the development of a national

                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s wars had roused feelings of patriotism in Italy, Germany,
                Russia and Spain. It was at least realized by the nations of continental Europe,

                            <p>The downfall of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> involved
                that of the political system of Europe which he had constructed. The changes wrought
                by the revolutionary period in the old states system were, however, too profound to
                admit of any attempt at a complete restoration, even had the interests of the allied
                powers been consistent with such a course. The object of the four great powers in
                whose hands the settlement of Europe now lay, was rather, after taking precautions
                to confine France within her <q>" legitimate boundaries,"</q> to arrange such a <q>"
                  just equilibrium "</q> in Europe that no individual state should for the future be
                in a position to overset the balance of power. The first object was to be attained
                by the re-establishment of the ancient dynasty in France, as a guarantee to Europe
                against a renewal of the revolutionary propaganda; the second was the work of the
                congress of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name>, by which, between September 1814 and June 1815, the reconstruction
                of Europe was taken in hand. The opening of the congress, in which for the first
                time all Europe seemed to be united for the friendly settlement of common <pb n="934" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0934.png"/> interests, was hailed as
                the dawn of a new era. In a sense it was so; but hardly in the manner nor to the
                degree that some had hoped. In its councils the arts of the old diplomacy, still
                inspired by the traditional principles or lack of principles, were directed to the
                old ends ; and the world, as though the popular upheaval of the Revolution had never
                been, was treated as real estate to be parcelled out by the executors of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s empire among sovereigns by divine right, regardless of the
                wishes of the populations, which figured in the protocols merely as numbers to be
                balanced and bartered one against the other.</p>
                            <p>This process of <ref>

                                </ref> called it, was naturally pregnant with possibilities of quarrels. Of these
                the most dangerous was that provoked by the resolution of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the emperor Alexander
                  I.</name> at all costs to keep the former <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Warsaw">grand-duchy of Warsaw</name> for
                himself, while compensating Prussia for the loss of some of her Polish territories
                by the annexation to her of all <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saxony">Saxony</name>. The deadlock caused by the
                stubborn insistence on this plan, which the other great powers were equally
                determined to frustrate, all but led to war, and by a secret treaty signed on the
                3rd of January 1815, Great Britain, France, and Austria agreed to make common cause
                in that event against Russia and Prussia. It needed <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s return
                from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elba">Elba</name> (March
                1815) to remind the powers that their particular interests must still be
                subordinated to those of Europe. The common peril restored the broken harmony; and
                while the armies of the Alliance were closing in for the final struggle with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">the French
                  emperor</name>, the congress hurried on its deliberations, and on the 9th of June
                1815, a few days before the battle of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Waterloo,_Belgium">Waterloo</name>, by which
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s power was finally shattered, <title>the Final Act</title>,

                            <p>The territorial arrangements thus effected were for half a century the basis of the
                states system of Europe, and the treaties in which they were defined the charter of
                international relations. It was in central Europe, where <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s policy
                had most profoundly affected the pre-revolutionary system, that the greatest changes
                were made. No attempt, indeed, was made to restore <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Holy Roman Empire</name>,
                in spite of the protest of the pope against the failure to re-establish <q>" the

                  the Rhine</name> having come to an end, Germany was reconstituted as a <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Confederation">a
                  confederation</name> of sovereign states, in which all the former members of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the
                  Empire</name> which had survived the revolutionary epoch found a place (see
                GERMANY). Austria, in virtue of the imperial tradition of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Habsburg">the house of Habsburg</name>,
                received the presidency of the federal <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichstag_(institution)">diet</name>; but the
                bulk of her territories lay outside the frontiers of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Confederation">the Confederation</name>,
                and the non-German character of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Habsburg">the Habsburg monarchy</name>
                was accentuated by the other arrangements at the congress. In Italy <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Lombardy-Venetia">Lombardo-Venetia</name> was erected into a kingdom under the Austrian crown;
                while the dynastic settlements in the other Italian states tended to make Austrian
                influence supreme in the peninsula (see ITALY). In return for this, Austria
                surrendered her claim to her former possessions in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Low_Countries">the Low Countries</name>, which
                were annexed to the crown of Holland, so as to form, under the title of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands">the United
                  Netherlands</name>, an efficient barrier to French aggression northwards. The
                function of defender of Germany on the Rhine frontier which Austria thus abandoned
                was assigned to Prussia, an arrangement pregnant with momentous issues. In
                compensation for her disappointment in the matter of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saxony">Saxony</name>, half of which was
                ultimately restored to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Wettin">the dynasty of Wettin</name>,
                she received a large accession of territory in the Rhine provinces, carved partly
                out of the suppressed <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Westphalia">kingdom of

                sufficiently powerful to be of any great importance in the general affairs of

                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>. She had, indeed, to restore to Austria the territories annexed

                placed in a position to continue her traditional policy of aiming at the position of
                a European great power and holding the balance between Austria and Prussia (see
                BAVARIA : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>). The two other German states whose

                            <p>Of great importance were the changes effected in the north and east of Europe. The

                  Bucharest (1812)</title> between Russia and Turkey had left in a very
                unsatisfactory condition, were not dealt with by the congress, in spite of the
                efforts of Great Britain to bring them into discussion. But the concessions made to
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the
                  emperor Alexander I.</name> elsewhere represented a notable advance in the
                European position of Russia. The possession of Finland, conquered from the Swedes in
                1808, was confirmed to her: and, above all, the erection of the former <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Warsaw">grand-duchy of
                  Warsaw</name> into a constitutional <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress_Poland">kingdom of Poland</name> under
                the Russian crown not only thrust the Muscovite power like a wedge into the heart of
                Germany, but seemed to threaten the Polish possessions of Austria and Prussia by
                setting up a quasi-independent Poland as a centre of attraction to the scattered
                elements of the Polish nation; though in the sequel the establishment of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kraków">the city of Cracow</name>
                and its territory as an independent <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Free_City_of_Kraków">republic</name>, to avoid
                the difficult question of its assignment elsewhere, proved a more fruitful source of
                nationalist unrest. In the north the settlement confirmed by the congress marked the
                definite withdrawal of the Scandinavian Powers from any active influence on the
                affairs of the continent. Alone of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                of Norway had been added. On the other hand, by the cession of Swedish <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pomerania">Pomerania</name> to
                Prussia Sweden finally withdrew from the southern shores of the Baltic. The
                Scandinavian states ceased henceforth to play any determining part in European
                politics. In the south, on the other hand, the restoration of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy">Savoy</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piedmont">Piedmont</name> to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Emmanuel_I_of_Sardinia">Victor Emmanuel

                factors pregnant with mighty issues. The object of this increase of the power of

                  house of Savoy</name> was but to erect a barrier against any possible renewal of

                            <p>The gains of Great Britain in Europe were comparatively small, though by no means

                            <p>After a quarter of a century of almost ceaseless wars, what Europe needed above all
                things was peace and time to recuperate. This conviction was common to all the
                powers who had inherited <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s
                dictatorship in Europe; but on the question of the method by which peace should be
                secured, and the principles which should guide their action a fateful divergence of
                view soon became apparent within their councils. All were agreed that France still
                represented the storm centre of Europe; and a <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Paris_(1815)">second treaty</title>,
                signed on the 20th of November 1815, renewed the provisions of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Chaumont">the treaty of

                idealist had borrowed the conception from the theorists of the 18th century (see
                ALEXANDER I., emperor of Russia). It was clear from the first that any attempt to
                set up such a central government of Europe under a <q>" universal guarantee"</q>
                would imperil the the independence of the sovereign states; and from the first Great
                Britain, represented by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Stewart,_Viscount_Castlereagh">Castlereagh</name>, protested against it. She would consent to take common action
                on the basis of the treaties she had actually signed, consulting with her allies on
                each case as it arose; but to vague and general engagements she refused to commit
                herself. The attitude of Austria and Prussia was from the outset less clear. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Klemens_Wenzel,_Prince_von_Metternich">Metternich</name> was torn between dread of revolution and dread of Russia; <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Alliance">The Holy

                            <p>Meanwhile the balance of forces within the European concert had shown a tendency to

                  Alexander</name>, his incalculable idealism, and his hardly veiled ambitions had
                drawn Austria and Great Britain together in common suspicion of an influence that
                threatened to be little less disturbing to the world's peace than that of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>. But at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aachen">Aix</name>

                at the discovery of revolutionary plots against his person, had already shown

                November 1820, and signed by Austria, Prussia and Russia. The immediate occasion of
                this manifesto was the military insurrection, under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guglielmo_Pepe">General Pepe</name>, at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples">Naples</name>, by which

                            </p>
                            <p>This was, in effect, an attempt to apply the principle of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carlsbad_Decrees">the Carlsbad Decrees</title> to
                all the world; and, had the attempt succeeded, all Europe would have been turned
                into a confederation on the model of that of Germany; for a political alliance,
                charged with the safeguarding of the territorial settlement defined by treaty, would
                have been substituted by a central diet of the great powers, armed with undefined
                authority ; and the sovereign independence of the nations would have been at an end.
                To any such principle, and therefore to the protocol in which it was embodied, Great
                Britain offered an uncompromising opposition. In vain <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Klemens_Wenzel,_Prince_von_Metternich">Metternich</name> urged upon <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Stewart,_Viscount_Castlereagh">Castlereagh</name> that the protocol was but the logical conclusion drawn from
                premises to which he was already committed ; for, if the alliance was to be
                effective in maintaining peace, it must interfere wherever and whenever peace should
                be threatened, and therefore to crush internal revolutions which could not but have
                an external result. The logic was perfect; the proposition that on which every <q>"
                  project of peace "</q> must eventually break. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Stewart,_Viscount_Castlereagh">Castlereagh</name>'s reply was, in brief, that Great Britain could never admit a
                principle which she would not in any circumstances allow to be applied in her own

                factors delayed the process, notably the revolt of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> against <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman
                  rule</name>, and the Spanish Question, which latter formed the main subject of
                discussion at the congress of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verona">Verona</name> in 1822. In the Eastern
                Question the interests of Austria and Great Britain were identical; both desired to
                maintain the integrity of Turkey; both saw that this integrity was in the greatest
                peril owing to the possible intervention of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the Orthodox tsar</name>
                in favour of his co-religionists in revolt; and both agreed that the best means of
                preventing such intervention was to bind <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the Russian emperor</name>
                to the European concert by using his devotion to the principles of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Alliance">the Holy
                  Alliance</name>. At <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verona">Verona</name>, however, the Eastern question was entirely overshadowed by that of
                Spain, and in this matter the views of Great Britain were diametrically opposed to
                those of the other powers of the alliance. She shared indeed with France and Austria
                the strenuous objection to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the emperor

                Jacobinism whether in France or Spain ; but she protested equally strenuously
                against the counterproposal of France, which was ultimately adopted, that a French
                army should march into Spain to liberate <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain">the king</name> from his
                constitutional fetters in the name of Europe. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Canning">George Canning</name>, carrying
                on the tradition of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Stewart,_Viscount_Castlereagh">Castlereagh</name>, once more protested, through <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington">Wellington</name>, as British plenipotentiary at the congress, against the whole
                principle of intervention ; and when, in spite of the British protest, the other
                powers persisted, the breach of Great Britain with the continental alliance was
                proclaimed to all the world. When, on the 7th of April 1823, the French army under

                Greece. Other forces making for political change were simultaneously at work. The
                peace secured by the concert of the powers had given free play to the mechanical and
                industrial innovations that heralded the marvellous economic revolution of the
                coming age ; wealth increased rapidly, and with it the influence and the ambition of

                advanced, e.g. Germany and Italy, the attempt to follow French example ended in
                failure ; but the revolt of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/page/Belgians">the Belgians</name>, for reasons partly
                economic and partly national, against the domination of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people">the Dutch</name>, resulted in the

                actual breach in the territorial settlement of 1815. In Great Britain the agitation
                of the disfranchised middle classes, which seemed to threaten a violent revolution,
                ended in 1832 in the passing of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reform_Act_1832">the Reform Bill</title> and
                their admission to political power. (See FRANCE ; GERMANY ; ITALY ; BELGIUM ;

                            <p>The easy success of the revolutions in the west of Europe had been due, not to any
                reluctance of the reactionary powers to interfere on the basis of the old
                agreements, but to their preoccupation with the national revolt in Poland (q.v). In
                view of this, and of the attitude of Great Britain, they had to recognize the title
                of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis-Philippe_d'Orléans,_King_of_the_French">Louis Philippe</name> as king of the French, merely stipulating that he should
                guarantee to maintain the treaties. In spite of the overthrow of the legitimate
                dynasty in France, and of the partition of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands">the kingdom of

                revolution of 1830, substantially intact. Outside the limits of the treaties,
                however, fateful changes were in progress. These were determined, broadly speaking,
                by the two main questions that dominated international politics between the years
                1831 and 1841: <list>

                had been forestalled by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Canning">Canning</name>'s recognition of
                the independence of the South American republics; the intrigues of France in favour
                of the partisans of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miguel_of_Portugal">Dom Miguel</name> in Portugal
                had been checkmated by a politic breach, on behalf of the Portuguese Liberals, of
                the British principle of non-intervention, and finally the chief cause of offence
                had been removed, in 1827, by the withdrawal of the French army of occupation from
                Spain. In the Greek question the two powers had acted cordially in concert; and this
                good understanding even the French conquest of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algeria">Algiers</name> in 1830, which laid the
                foundations of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_colonial_empire">the French empire</name>
                in Africa, had not availed to shatter; for the eyes of the Tory ministry were still
                fixed on France as the potential focus of revolutionary propaganda, and any over-sea
                possessions she might acquire were, in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington">Wellington</name>'s opinion, so many hostages for her good behaviour given to

                            <p>The cleavage between the fundamental principles of the two groups of autocratic and
                constitutional powers was not only apparent in their general attitude towards
                constitutional and national movements, but affected also the position taken up by
                them during the crisis of the Eastern question evoked by the revolt of <name type="person">Mehemet Ali, pasha of Egypt</name>, a crisis by which between 1839
                and 1841 all other diplomatic issues were overshadowed. (See MEHEMET ALI.) During
                the Greek revolt the efforts of Austria had been directed to preventing a Russian
                attack upon Turkey ; these efforts had failed, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Klemens_Wenzel,_Prince_von_Metternich">Metternich</name>'s worst fears seemed to be realized when the Russo - Turkish
                campaigns of 1828-29 issued in <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Adrianople">the treaty of
                  Adrianople</title> (September 14, 1829) and the apparently complete vassalage of
                the sultan to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_I_of_Russia">the tsar</name>. But when,
                in 1832, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mahmud_II">Sultan
                  Mahmud</name> appealed in his despair to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_I_of_Russia">the emperor Nicholas</name>
                to save him from ruin at the hands of the Egyptian rebels, and, as the result,
                  <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Hünkâr_İskelesi">the treaty of
                  Unkiar Skelessi</title> (July 8, 1833) seemed to place definitively in the hands
                of Russia the keys of the Black Sea, it was left to France and Great Britain to give
                voice to the protest of Europe. Austria, alarmed by the revolutionary movements of
                1830, accepted the fact of Russian preponderance at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name>, rather
                than risk a breach with the autocrat who was now the main pillar of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Alliance">the Holy
                  Alliance</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_I_of_Russia">The emperor
                Nicholas</name>, for his part, was equally prepared to surrender some of his
                ambitions in the East for the sake of the common cause, the more so since to Russian
                statesmen the maintenance of Turkey in a condition of weakness and dependence now
                seemed preferable to any attempt to break it up. The result of these dispositions
                was the convention of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mnichovo_Hradiště">Münchengrätz</name> (September
                18, 1833) between Russia, Austria and Prussia, by which the three powers undertook
                to guarantee the integrity of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman empire</name>. In the
                following month a secret convention was signed at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> between the same powers
                (October 15), reaffirming the right of the powers to intervene in the internal
                affairs of a friendly state at the request of its legitimate sovereign, a right with
                which no third power would be allowed to interfere, such interference to be regarded
                by the three powers as an act of hostility directed against all of them.</p>

                have been detached and spasmodic. It was this simultaneity which gave to the
                revolutions of 1848 their European character and their formidable force. They were
                the outcome of various, dissimilar and sometimes contradictory impulses — political,
                social, racial. In France the issue resolved itself into a struggle between the new

                than real. The victory of the democratic forces had been too easy, too seemingly
                overwhelming; the establishment of the constitutional principle in the main centres
                of autocracy seemed to make common action against the powers of reaction of
                secondary importance, and free play was allowed to the racial and national
                antagonisms that had been present from the first. The battle of German, as well as

                Germany ; and Prussia, her military prestige restored, stood once more face to face

                of the established order. At the outset, indeed, it was his policy to pose as its
                custodian. To conciliate the French clericals he supported <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Pius_IX">Pope Pius IX.</name> against the
                Italian Liberals; but otherwise he proclaimed aloud his devotion to the arts of
                peace. A period of rapid material expansion succeeded the unrest of the
                revolutionary years ; engineers and men of science were quickly producing a change
                in all the material conditions of life, greater than could have been effected by any
                political revolution; especially the face of Europe was gradually being covered with
                a network of railways, which it was hoped would draw the European nations not only
                materially but morally closer together. The first universal exhibition, opened under

                soon to be belied by the hard logic of events. For no period since 1815 has been so
                occupied with wars and the rumours of war as the twenty years that followed the
                opening of this great temple of peace.</p>

                SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN QUESTION). But about the same time anxious watchers noticed on
                the political horizon in the East a cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, that
                threatened a serious storm. At first this was no more than a quarrel between Greek
                and Latin monks about the custody of certain holy places and things in Palestine.
                  <pb n="940" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0940.png"/> It soon, however,
                became clear that behind these insignificant combatants loomed the figures of the

                this matter were partly political, partly personal. He resented <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_I_of_Russia">the tsar</name>'s attitude
                towards himself; he wished to gain the firm support of the clergy for his throne; he
                desired to win prestige for himself and his dynasty by reasserting the traditional
                influence of France in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman empire</name>. The
                events that led up to the Crimean War, and those of the war itself, are told
                elsewhere (see CRIMEAN WAR). Great Britain had been drawn into the war by her
                traditional policy of preserving <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman empire</name> as a
                barrier against the advance of Russia to the Mediterranean and the consequent danger

                  British empire</name> in India. It is now generally conceded that, so far as these
                objects were concerned, the war was a tragic mistake. The hopes that were built on
                the capacity of Turkey to reform itself were disappointed; the restrictions imposed
                upon Russia were repudiated at the first opportunity, during the Franco-German War
                in 1870; and the results of the Russo-Turkish War of 1876 have shown that a far more
                effective barrier against Russia than the weakened <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman empire</name> has been
                furnished by the young and vigorous national states of the Balkan Peninsula. None

                the impetus given by it to the development of an effective international law. The

                obligations of Europe towards it. The congress, moreover, acted in some sort as the
                legislative body of Europe; it established the principle of the free navigation of
                the Danube and of the right of all nations to carry their commerce into the Black
                Sea ; by a declaration, signed by all the powers present, it abolished the practice
                of granting letters of marque to privateers in war time. The question was even
                discussed of establishing some sanction by which the rules of international law
                agreed upon should be enforced upon recalcitrant states ; and, though nothing was

                            <p>The conclusion of the Crimean War left <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">the emperor
                  Napoleon</name> the most influential personage in Europe; and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>, the seat of the congress,
                became also the centre of the diplomatic world. Russia had been bled almost to death
                by the war; Austria was discredited and isolated owing to the dubious part she had
                played in it; Prussia had not recovered from the humiliation of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olomouc">Olmütz</name>; Great Britain was soon
                plunged into the critical struggle of the Indian Mutiny. The time was obviously
                opportune for the realization of some of the aspirations implied in the Napoleonic
                idea. The opportunity came from the side of Italy. By sending Sardinian troops to
                fight in a quarrel not their own, alongside the Allies in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crimea">the Crimea</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camillo_Benso,_conte_di_Cavour">Cavour</name> had
                purchased for <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piedmont">Piedmont</name> the right to be heard in the councils of the powers—a right of
                which he had made use at the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> congress to denounce before
                all Europe the Austrian misrule in Italy. The Italian unionists were at one with
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> in desiring to overset <q>" the treaties "</q> ; and the Franco-
                Italian alliance which, in 1859, drove the Austrians out of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lombardy">Lombardy</name> and established the
                nucleus of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861–1946)">the Italian
                  kingdom</name> was the beginning of a process which, within twelve years, was to
                change the balance of Europe. It was ominous of the future that it was largely the
                menace of Prussian intervention that persuaded <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> to
                conclude the armistice of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Villafranca_di_Verona">Villafranca</name> (July
                11, 1859), which, contrary to his agreement with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy">Victor
                  Emmanuel</name>, left <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venice">Venice</name> to the Austrians. In spite of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Zürich">the peace of Zürich</title>
                (November 10), indeed, the union of Italy continued during the succeeding years, and
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy">Savoy</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nice">Nice</name> were the reward of
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">the
                  French emperor</name>'s connivance (see ITALY). France thus once more gained her
                  <q>" natural frontier "</q> of the Alps ; the question was whether she would be
                able to regain her other natural frontier on the Rhine. The times were
                not-unpropitious for an enterprise which was undoubtedly one of the main objects of
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s policy. The European concert had ceased to exist as an
                effective force ; the treaties had been violated with impunity ; in Germany, where
                the tension between the two great powers had not been eased by Prussia's dubious
                attitude during the war, there was little prospect of a united opposition to French
                aggression, and the conditions seemed highly favourable for reviving the traditional
                policy of exploiting German disunion for the aggrandizement of France. Prussia was
                arming, but her armaments were directed not against <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> but
                against Austria; and the beginning of the reign of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">William I.</name>, who
                had become regent in 1858 and king in 1861, pointed to the development of a
                situation in which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">the French emperor</name>
                would once again become the arbiter of Germany. On the 29th of March 1862 Prussia
                signed a commercial treaty with France on a basis that involved the exclusion of
                Austria from <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zollverein">the Zollverein</name>, and replied to the protests of the court of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name> by recognizing
                the new <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861–1946)">kingdom of
                  Italy</name>. In September of the same year <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">King William</name>
                placed the supreme direction of Prussian policy in the hands of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</name>,
                whose views on the exclusion of Austria from Germany were known to all the
                world.</p>

                            <p>The outcome of the Polish insurrection of 1863, however, again altered the aspect
                of things, and in a direction unfavourable to France (see POLAND : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>). <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> had been
                forced by French public opinion to come forward as the protector of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poles">the Poles</name>; but the
                spectacle of a <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Bonaparte</name> posing
                as the champion of <q>" the treaties "</q> was not impressive; his brave words were
                not translated into action ; and he only succeeded in offending Russia by his
                protests and alienating Great Britain by his tergiversations. The proffered
                intervention of Austria, France and Great Britain was rejected in a note of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">Prince
                  Gorchakov</name> to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_von_Brunnow">Baron Brunnow</name>, the
                Russian ambassador in London (July 1, 1863) ; no action followed ; and the last
                effort to put forward the treaties of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name> as the common law of Europe
                ended in a fiasco. British ministers, who had been made to look somewhat ridiculous,
                henceforth began to be chary of active intervention in continental affairs; Austria
                and France were alike discredited and isolated. Prussia which, under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s auspices, had aided Russia in suppressing <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poles">the Poles</name> (convention of February
                8, 1863) alone emerged from the crisis with increased prestige. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>, indeed, was
                too wary to accept <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name>'s
                suggestion of an offensive alliance and an immediate combined attack on Austria and
                France; but in the coming struggle for the hegemony of Germany he was assured at
                least of Russia's neutrality.</p>

                            <p>The final act in this long rivalry began with the opening up of the

                  Denmark</name> and the accession of the <q>" protocol-king"</q>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_IX_of_Denmark">Christian IX.</name> (November 15, 1863). The German claim to the Elbe duchies,
                the Danish claim to least <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Schleswig">Schleswig</name> as an
                integral part of the northern kingdom, were but subordinate issues of questions far
                more fateful, the developments of which once more illustrated the hopeless
                enfeeblement of the idea of the European concert. In the struggle for the possession
                of the duchies the general sentiment of Germany was on one side, that of Europe on
                the other. By the protocol of 1852 the duchies had been treated as an integral part
                of Denmark, and France and Great Britain, as signatory powers, alike protested
                against the action <pb n="941" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0941.png"/> of
                Austria and Prussia in asserting the German claim by force of arms. But, as in the
                case of Poland, protests were not followed by action ; <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> in the
                end contented himself with proposing his favourite <q>" Napoleonic idea "</q> of a
                plebiscite, to discover the wishes of the populations concerned; <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_John_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston">Palmerston</name>, who realized some of the important issues involved, allowed
                his warlike attitude, under exalted influences, to evaporate in words. Thus Great
                Britain earned the lasting resentment of Germans, without succeeding in preventing
                the establishment of German sea-power in the Baltic. For the Prussian war-harbour of
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiel">Kiel</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiel_Canal">the Kiel canal</name>
                were in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s mind from the outset. Throughout he intended to make the
                duchies a part of Prussia and to use the whole question as a means for the solution
                of that of Germany. The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 grew inevitably out of the
                Dano-German War of 1864 ; and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Prague_(1866)">the treaty of

                rapid and overwhelming victory of Prussia overthrew all the calculations of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name>, who had looked to intervening as arbiter between exhausted
                combatants. The sudden menace of the new German power alarmed him, and he sought to
                secure the Rhine frontier for France, by negotiations with Prussia, in the form of
                  <q>" compensations "</q> at the expense of the South German states. He succeeded
                only in placing a fresh weapon in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s hands. The
                communication of the French overtures to the South German courts was enough to throw
                them into the arms of Prussia; and treaties of offensive and defensive alliance were
                signed in August 1866 between Prussia and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Württemberg">Württemberg</name> (3rd), <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baden">Baden</name> (17th), and

                                <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luxembourg">Luxemburg</name> was

                            <p>Meanwhile public feeling in France had become seriously excited by this sudden
                menace of a hostile power on her eastern frontier, and this excitement was raised to
                fever heat when it became known that the vacant throne of Spain had been offered to
                and accepted by a prince of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Hohenzollern">the house of
                  Hohenzollern</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s policy
                had become hopelessly discredited by the successive fiascos in Poland, Mexico and
                Germany, and even the establishment of a liberal constitution in 1869 could not
                avail to restore public confidence in him. He knew the risk he ran in challenging a
                conflict with a power whose military efficiency had been so strikingly displayed;
                but by refusing to do so, in the excited state of public feeling, he would have
                risked his throne. He reckoned on the traditional jealousy of the South German
                states for Prussia and their traditional friendship with France; he was assured,
                too, of the support of Austria, in the event of a victorious opening of the
                campaign. On the other hand <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> was bent on
                war, which, in accordance with his policy of <q>" blood and iron,"</q> he believed
                to be the sole effective means of binding the heterogeneous elements of Germany into

                an irresistible volume to the cry of the war party in France; and on the 19th of

                            <p>The most important outcome of the events which culminated in the Franco-German War
                and its result was the establishment of a powerful <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">German empire</name>, which was
                destined to dominate the continent for years to come, and the expansive ambitions of
                which remain pregnant with menace for the future. So great an overturn, however,
                involved other changes in the territorial system, which may be briefly summarized.
                The most notable of these was the reconstruction of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austrian_Empire">the Austrian monarchy</name> as
                a result of the war of 1866. By <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Vienna_(1866)">the treaty of
                  Vienna</title> (October 3, 1866) between Austria and Italy, Austria recognized

                domination in Italy. This was followed in 1867 by the establishment of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria–Hungary">the Dual
                  Monarchy</name> in the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Habsburg">Habsburg</name> dominions

                southern Italy. On the 17th of March <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy">Victor Emmanuel
                  II.</name> was proclaimed king of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861–1946)">United
                Italy</name>. This title, as mentioned above, was recognized by Austria in 1866,
                when Italy was increased by the cession of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venice">Venice</name>. Finally, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome">Rome</name>, which had been

                            <p>By the Franco-German War of 1870-71 and the creation of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">the German empire</name> the
                political condition of Europe was profoundly changed. Germany became for a time the
                leading power on the continent of Europe, and German statesmanship had to devise
                means for preventing, until the new edifice was thoroughly consolidated, the
                formation of a hostile coalition of jealous rivals. The first thing to be done in
                this direction was to secure the support of Russia and Austria to the new order of
                things.</p>
                            <p>With regard to Russia there was little cause for apprehension. She had aided <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>
                to carry out his audacious schemes in the past, and there was no reason to suppose
                that she would change her policy in the immediate future. The <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                                    <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi>
                                </foreign> dated from the Polish insurrection of 1863 ; when the governments of
                France and England, yielding to popular excitement, made strong diplomatic
                representations to Russia in favour of the Poles, whereas <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> not only
                refused to join in the diplomatic campaign, but made a convention with the cabinet
                of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St
                  Petersburg</name> by which the Russian and German military authorities on the
                frontiers should aid each other in suppressing the disturbances. From that time the
                friendship ripened steadily. The relations between the two powers were not, it is
                true, always without a cloud. More than once the bold designs of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> caused
                uneasiness and dissatisfaction in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name>,
                especially during the Schleswig- Holstein complications of 1864 and the
                Austro-Prussian conflict of 1866; but the wily statesman of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name>, partly by argument and
                partly by dexterously manipulating the mutual trust and affection between the two
                sovereigns, always succeeded in having his own way without producing a rupture, so
                that during the Franco-German War of 1870-71 Russia maintained an extremely
                benevolent neutrality, and prevented Austria and Italy from taking part in the
                struggle. So benevolent was the neutrality that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the emperor
                  William</name> at the end of the campaign felt constrained to write to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the

                happy issue of the campaign and would never forget the fact. Having thus helped to

                programme, the permanent conciliation of Austria, was not so easily carried out.
                Austria had been the great sufferer, more perhaps even than France, from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s aggressive policy. For generations she had resisted strenuously

                to play the leading part in Germany, and she had always considered her own influence
                in Germany as essential to the maintenance of her position as a first-class power.
                By the disastrous campaign of 1866 and the consequent <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Prague_(1866)">treaty of Prague</title>,
                Austria had been formally excluded from all direct influence in German affairs. With

                negotiating with the French government for a combined attack on Prussia. To an
                ordinary statesman the task of permanently conciliating such a power might well have
                seemed hopeless, but <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> did not shrink from it, and even before the signature of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Prague_(1866)">the treaty of
                    Prague</title> he had prepared the way for attaining his object. <quote>" With
                    regard to Austria," he himself explained on one occasion, " I had two courses
                    open to me after her defeat, either to destroy her entirely or to respect her
                    integrity and prepare for our future reconciliation when the fire of revenge had
                    died out. I chose the latter course, because the former would have been the
                    greatest possible act of folly. Supposing that Austria had disappeared, consider
                    the consequences."</quote> He then described very graphically those probable
                  consequences, and drew the conclusion: <quote>" for the sake of our own life
                    Austria must live. I had no hesitation, therefore, and ever since 1866 my
                    constant effort has been to stitch up the great torn texture and to re-establish
                    amicable relations with our ancient associate of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Confederation">the

                                </ref> For this purpose he tried to soothe Austrian susceptibilities, and suggested
                confidentially that compensation for the losses of territory, influence and prestige
                in Italy and Germany might be found in south-eastern Europe, especially by the
                acquisition of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina">Bosnia and

                usual caution. He gave it to be clearly understood that improvement in his relations

                not disturb the long-established friendship with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">The
                  tsar</name>, on hearing privately of the intended meeting, gave a hint to <name type="person">Prince Reuss</name>, the German ambassador, that he expected an
                invitation, and was invited accordingly. The meeting of the three sovereigns took
                place at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name>
                at the end of August 1872. The three ministers, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Prince Bismarck</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">Prince
                  Gorchakov</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Count Andrássy</name>, held daily
                conferences, on the basis that the chief aim in view should be the maintenance of
                peace in Europe, and that in all important international affairs the three powers
                should consult with each other and act in concert. As a result of three days'
                consultation <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the Three Emperors'
                  League</name> was founded, without any formal treaty being signed. In this way the
                danger of a powerful coalition being formed against the young German empire was
                averted, for in the event of a conflict with France, Germany could count on at least
                the benevolent neutrality of Russia and Austria, and from the other powers she had
                nothing to fear. What ulterior designs <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> may have had

                thus: <quote>" To make Austria accept definitively her deposition as a Germanic

                            <p>For more than two years there was an outward appearance of extreme cordiality
                between the three powers. They acted together diplomatically, and on all suitable
                occasions the three allied monarchs exchanged visits and sent each other
                congratulations and good wishes. There was, however, from the beginning very little
                genuine confidence between them. Before the breaking up of the conferences at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">Alexander
                  II.</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">his chancellor</name> had
                conversations with the Erench ambassador, in which they not only showed that they
                had suspicions of future aggressive designs on the part of Germany, but also gave an
                assurance that so long as France fulfilled her engagements to Germany she had
                nothing to fear. A few months later, when <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the emperor
                  William</name> paid his return visit to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St
                  Petersburg</name>, a defensive convention was concluded by the two monarchs behind
                the back of their Austrian ally. Without knowing anything about the existence of
                this convention, the Austrian ally did not feel comfortable in his new position. In
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name> the old
                anti-Prussian feeling was still strong. The so-called party of the archdukes and the
                military resisted the policy of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Andrássy</name>, and sought to
                establish closer relations with Russia, so that German support might be unnecessary,
                but as <ref>

                    wound caused by the conduct of Austria during the Crimean War was not yet
                    healed. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Andrássy</name> made himself very popular in the court society of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St
                      Petersburg</name> during his visit there with his imperial master, but the
                    traditional suspicion of Austrian policy remained."</quote>
                                </ref> Altogether, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the new
                  league</name> was not a happy family. So long as all the members of it were

                                    <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                </foreign>, the latent germs of dissension remained hidden from the outside world,
                but as soon as the temporary state of political quietude was replaced by a certain
                amount of activity and initiative, they forced their way to the surface. No one of
                the three powers regarded the <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                    <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                </foreign> as a satisfactory permanent arrangement. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> much anxiety was caused by
                the rapid financial and military recovery of France, and voices were heard
                suggesting that a new campaign and a bigger war indemnity might be necessary before
                the recuperation was complete. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name> there was
                a determination to take advantage of any good opportunity for recovering the portion
                of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name>
                ceded by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Paris_(1856)">the treaty
                  of Paris</title>, and thereby removing the last tangible results of the Crimean
                War. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name>
                there was a desire to obtain in the Balkan Peninsula, in accordance with the
                suggestion of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>, compensation
                for the losses in Italy and Germany. Thus each of the members of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the league</name> was hatching secretly a little aggressive scheme for its own
                benefit, and the danger for the rest of Europe lay in the possibility of their
                reconciling their schemes so far as to admit of an agreement for action in common.
                Fortunately for the onlookers there were important conflicting interests, and the
                task of reconciling them was extremely difficult, as the subsequent course of events
                proved.</p>

                            <p>The first of the three powers to move was Germany. In February 1875 <name type="person">M. de Radowitz</name> was despatched to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name> on a
                secret mission in order to discover whether, in the event of hostilities between
                Germany and France, Russia would undertake to maintain a neutral attitude as she had
                done in 1870-1871; in that case Germany might be relied on to co-operate with her in
                her great designs in the East. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">Prince Gorchakov</name> did
                not take the bait with the alacrity that was expected. Having overcome in some
                measure his hatred of Austria, which had distorted for so many years his political
                vision, he had come to understand that it was not for the interests of his own
                country to have as neighbour a powerful united Germany instead of a weak
                confederation of small states, and he now perceived that it would be a grave error
                of policy to allow Germany to destroy still more to her own advantage the balance of
                power in Europe by permanently weakening France. No doubt he desired to recover the
                lost portion of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name> and to raise Russian prestige in the East, but he did not wish
                to run the risk of exciting a great European war, and he believed that what he
                desired might be effected without war by the diplomatic skill which had warded off
                European intervention during the Polish troubles of 1863, and had recovered for
                Russia her freedom of action in the Black Sea during the Franco-Prussian War of
                1870-71. In reply, therefore, to <name type="person">M. de Radowitz</name>'s
                inquiries and suggestions, he declared that the Russian court fostered no ambitious
                designs in the East or in the West, and desired only peace and the maintenance of
                the <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                    <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                </foreign>, with possibly an amelioration in the miserable condition of the
                Christian subjects of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdülaziz">the sultan</name>. This rebuff did not
                suffice to dispel the gathering storm. The warlike agitation in the German inspired
                press continued, and the French government became thoroughly alarmed. <name type="person">General Leflô</name>, the French ambassador in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name>, was
                instructed to sound the Russian government on the subject. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">Prince Gorchakov</name>
                willingly assured him that Russia would do all in her power to incline the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> cabinet to
                moderation and peace, and that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the emperor</name> would
                take advantage of his forthcoming visit to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> to influence <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the
                  emperor William</name> in this sense. A few days later <name type="person">General
                  Leflô</name> received similar assurances from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the emperor</name>
                himself, and about the same time the British government volunteered to work likewise
                in the cause of peace. Representations were accordingly made by both governments
                during <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name>'s visit to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name>, and both <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the

                that there was no intention of attacking France. The danger of war, which the
                well-informed German press believed to be " in sight," was thus averted, but the
                incident sowed the seeds of future troubles, by awakening in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> a bitter
                personal resentment against his Russian colleague. By certain incautious remarks to

                            <p>The next move in the aggressive game was made by Austria, with the connivance of
                Russia. During the summer of 1875 an insurrection of the Christian Slavs in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herzegovina">Herzegovina</name>,
                which received support from the neighbouring principalities of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montenegro">Montenegro</name> and Servia, was
                fostered by the Austrian authorities and encouraged by the Russian consuls on the
                Adriatic coast. A European concert was formed for the purpose of settling the
                disturbance by means of local administrative reforms, but the efforts of the powers
                failed, because the insurgents hoped to obtain complete liberation from Turkish
                rule; and in the beginning of July, with a view to promoting this solution, Servia
                and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montenegro">Montenegro</name> declared war against <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name>. Thereupon
                Russia began to show her hand more openly. The government allowed volunteers to be
                recruited in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/MoSCoW">Moscow</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name>, and the
                Russian <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mikhail_Chernyayev">general Chernayev</name>, who had distinguished himself in Central Asia, was
                appointed to the <pb n="944" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0944.png"/> command
                of the Servian army. When the ball had thus been set rolling, the two powers chiefly
                concerned considered that the time had come for embodying the result of their
                informal confidential pourparlers in a secret agreement, which is known as <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichstadt_Agreement">the convention of
                  Reichstadt</title>, because it was signed at a meeting of the two emperors in the
                little Bohemian town of that name. It bore the date of the 8th of July 1876—exactly
                a week after Servia and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montenegro">Montenegro</name> had declared
                war—and it contained the following stipulations: <list>
                                    <item>(1) That so long as the struggle which had just begun remained undecided,
                    the two sovereigns should refrain from interference, and that in the event of

                                    <item>(2) that in the event of the principalities proving victorious, and
                    territorial changes taking place, Austria should claim compensation in Bosnia
                    and Herzegovina, and Russia should demand the restitution of the portion of
                      <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name> which she had lost by the Crimean War;</item>
                                    <item>(3) that in the event of the collapse of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman empire</name>,
                    the two powers should act together to create autonomous principalities in
                    European Turkey, to unite <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly">Thessaly</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">Crete</name> to Greece,
                    and to proclaim <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> a free
                    town</item>
                                </list>. The contracting parties evidently expected that the two principalities
                would be victorious in their struggle with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name>, and that the
                compensations mentioned would be secured without a great European war. Their
                expectations were disappointed. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montenegro">Montenegro</name> made a brave stand
                against superior forces, but before five months had passed Servia was at the mercy
                of the Turkish army, and Russia had to come to the assistance of her protégé. A
                Russian ultimatum stopped the advance of the Turks on <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgrade">Belgrade</name>, and an armistice,
                subsequently transformed into a peace, was signed.</p>

                            <p>Russia and Austria had now to choose between abandoning their schemes and adopting
                some other course of action, and unforeseen incidents contributed towards making
                them select the latter alternative. In June 1876 an attempt at insurrection in
                Bulgaria had been repressed with savage brutality by the Turks, and the details, as
                they became known some weeks later, produced much indignation all over Europe. In
                England the excitement, fanned by the eloquence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Gladstone">Gladstone</name>, became
                intense, and compelled the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Disraeli">Disraeli</name> cabinet to
                take part, very reluctantly, in a diplomatic campaign, with the object of imposing
                radical reforms on Turkey. In Russia the excitement and indignation were equally
                great, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name> gradually
                formed the resolution that if the powers would not act collectively and
                energetically, so as to compel <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> to yield, he
                would undertake the work single-handed. This resolution he announced publicly in a
                speech delivered at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/MoSCoW">Moscow</name> on the 10th of November 1876. The powers did not like the idea of
                separate Russian action, and in order to prevent it they agreed to hold a conference
                in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> for the purpose of inducing <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> to introduce the
                requisite reforms. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">The Porte</name> was at that
                moment under the influence of popular patriotic excitement which made it indisposed
                to accept orders, or even well-meant advice, from governments more or less hostile
                to it, and the inconsiderate mode of procedure suggested by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_Pavlovich_Ignatiev">General
                  Ignatiev</name>, and adopted by the other delegates, made it still more
                unconciliatory. At the first plenary sitting of the conference the proceedings were
                disturbed by the sound of artillery, and the Turkish representative explained that
                the salvo was in honour of the new Ottoman constitution, which was being promulgated
                by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the
                  sultan</name>. The inference suggested was that as Turkey had spontaneously
                entered on the path of liberal and constitutional reform for all Ottoman subjects,
                it became superfluous and absurd to talk of small reforms for particular provinces,
                such as the conference was about to propose. The deliberations continued, but
                finally <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> refused to accept what the plenipotentiaries considered an
                irreducible minimum, and the conference broke up without obtaining any practical
                result. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">The tsar</name>'s <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/MoSCoW">Moscow</name> declaration about employing singlehanded the requisite coercive

                            <p>In order to make a successful aggressive move on Turkey, Russia had first of all to
                secure her rear and flank by an arrangement with her two allies. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> she
                encountered no difficulties. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had no
                objection to seeing Russia weaken herself in a struggle with Turkey, provided she
                did not upset the balance of power in south-eastern Europe, and he felt confident
                that he could prevent by diplomatic means any such catastrophe. He was inclined,
                therefore, to encourage rather than restrain the bellicose tendencies of St
                Petersburg. In Vienna the task of coming to a definite arrangement was much more
                difficult, and it was only after protracted and laborious negotiations that a
                convention was concluded on the 15th of January 1877, and formally signed three
                months later. It was a development of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichstadt_Agreement">the agreement of
                  Reichstadt</title>, modified according to the changes in the situation, but
                retaining the essential principle that in the event of the territorial <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                    <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                </foreign> being altered, Russia should recover the lost portion of Bessarabia, and
                Austria should get Bosnia and a part of Herzegovina. Having made these preliminary
                arrangements, Russia began the campaign simultaneously in Europe and Asia Minor, and
                after many reverses and enormous sacrifices of blood and treasure, she succeeded in
                imposing on the Turks the <q>" preliminary peace "</q> of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yeşilköy">San Stefano</name> (3rd March 1878).
                That peace was negotiated with very little consideration for the interests of the
                other powers, and as soon as the terms of it became known in Vienna and London there
                was an outburst of indignation. In negotiating the treaty <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_Pavlovich_Ignatiev">General
                  Ignatiev</name> had ignored the wishes of Austria, and had even, according to the
                contention of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Andrássy</name>, infringed the convention signed at the beginning of the war.
                However this may be, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_San_Stefano">the peace of San Stefano</title> brought to the surface the latent conflict of
                interests between the two empires. Russia's aim was to create a big Bulgaria under
                the influence of St Petersburg, and to emancipate Servia and Montenegro as far as
                possible from Austrian influence, whereas Austria objected to the creation of any
                large Slav stats in the Balkan Peninsula, and insisted on maintaining her influence
                at Belgrade and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetinje">Tsetigne (Cetinje)</name>. In vain <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">Prince Gorchakov</name>
                endeavoured to conciliate Austria and to extract from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Count Andrássy</name> a clear
                statement of the terms he would accept. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Count Andrássy</name> was in no
                hurry to extricate Russia from her difficulties, and suggested that the whole
                question should be submitted to a European congress. The suggestion was endorsed by
                Great Britain, which likewise objected to <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_San_Stefano">the San Stefano
                  arrangements</title>, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> declined to
                bring any pressure to bear on the cabinet of Vienna.</p>

                            <p>Deceived in her expectations of active support from her two allies Russia found
                herself in an awkward position. From a military point of view it was absolutely
                necessary for her to come to an arrangement either with Austria or with England,
                because the communications of her army before Constantinople with its base could be
                cut by these two powers acting in concert —the land route being dominated by
                Austria, and the Black Sea route by the British fleet, which was at that time
                anchored in the Sea of Marmora. As soon, therefore, as the efforts to obtain the
                support of her two allies against the demands of England had failed, negotiations
                were opened in London, and on the 30th of May a secret convention was signed by
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Cecil,_3rd_Marquess_of_Salisbury">Lord

                  Schuvalov</name>. By that agreement the obstacles to the assembling of the
                congress were removed. The congress met in Berlin on the 13th of June, and after
                many prolonged sittings and much secret negotiation <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878)">the treaty of
                  Berlin</title> was signed on the 13th of July. By <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878)">that treaty</title> the

                Danube and the Balkans being transformed into a vassal principality, the part
                between the Balkans and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhodope_Mountains">the Rhodope</name> being made
                into an autonomous province, called <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eastern_Rumelia">Eastern Rumelia</name>,under a
                Christian governor named by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name> with the assent
                of the powers, and the remainder being placed again under the direct rule of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the

                Crimean War. In Asia Minor Russia agreed to confine her annexations to the districts

                restore to Turkey the remainder of the occupied territory. As a set-off against the
                large acquisitions of the Slav races, the powers recommended that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name>
                should cede to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Greece">the kingdom of Greece</name>

                on this recommendation, but in March 1881 a compromise was effected by which Greece

                secure good administration throughout the whole of Asia Minor by the introduction of

                  Reichstadt</title> and the subsequent Austro-Russian <title>treaty of
                  Vienna</title>, had thus been realized. Russia had recovered the lost portion of
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name>,
                and Austria had practically annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, though the nominal
                suzerainty of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name> over the two provinces was maintained. But Russia was far from
                satisfied with the results, which seemed to her not at all commensurate with the
                sacrifices imposed on her by the war, and her dissatisfaction led to a new grouping
                of the powers. Before the opening of the Berlin congress <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had announced
                publicly that he would refrain from taking sides with any of the contending parties,
                and would confine himself to playing the part of an honest broker. The announcement
                was received by the Russians with astonishment and indignation. What they expected
                was not an impartial arbiter, but a cordial and useful friend in need. In 1871 <ref>

                                </ref> Now, in 1878, when the moment had come for paying at least an instalment of
                this debt, and when Russia was being compelled to make concessions which she
                described as incompatible with her dignity, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had nothing
                better to offer than honest brokerage. The indignation in all classes was intense,

                  duplicity "</q> and <q>" treachery "</q> were supposed to receive ample
                confirmation during the sittings of the congress and the following six months. On
                the 4th of February 1879 <ref>

                                </ref> The same view of the situation was taken in Berlin and Vienna, though the
                result was attributed, of course, to different causes, and the danger of serious
                complications became so great that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> concluded with
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Andrássy</name> in the following October (1879) a formal defensive alliance,
                which was avowedly directed against Russia, and which subsequently developed into
                  <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">the Triple Alliance</name>, directed against Russia and France.</p>
                            <p>The causes of the rupture are variously described by the different parties
                interested. According to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> the Russian
                government began a venomous campaign against Germany in the press, and collected,
                with apparently hostile intentions, enormous masses of troops near the German and
                Austrian frontiers, whilst <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name> adopted
                in his correspondence with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the emperor
                  William</name> an arrogant and menacing tone which could not be tolerated. On the
                other hand, the Russians declare that the so-called Press-Campaign was merely the
                spontaneous public expression of the prevailing disappointment among all classes in
                Russia, that the military preparations had a purely defensive character, and that
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the
                  tsar</name>'s remarks, which roused <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s ire, did not
                transgress the limits of friendly expostulation such as sovereigns in close friendly
                relations might naturally employ. <figure>

                                </figure> Subsequent revelations tend rather to confirm the Russian view. After an
                exhausting war and without a single powerful ally, Russia was not likely to provoke
                wantonly a great war with Germany and Austria. The press attacks were not more
                violent than those which frequently appear in newspapers which draw their
                inspiration from the German foreign office, and the accusations about the arrogant
                attitude and menacing tone of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">Alexander II.</name> are
                not at all in harmony with his known character, and are refuted by the documents
                since published by <name type="person">Dr Busch</name>. The truth seems to be that
                the self-willed <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">chancellor</name> was actuated
                by nervous irritation and personal feeling more than by considerations of
                statecraft. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">His imperial
                  master</name> was not convinced by his arguments, and showed great reluctance to
                permit the conclusion of a separate treaty with Austria. Finally, with much
                searching of heart, he yielded to the importunity of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">his minister</name>; but in
                thus committing an unfriendly act towards his old ally, he so softened the blow that
                the personal good relations between the two sovereigns suffered merely a momentary
                interruption. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> himself soon
                recognized that the permanent estrangement of Russia would be a grave mistake of
                policy, and the very next year (1880), negotiations for a treaty of defensive
                alliance between the two cabinets were begun. Nor did the accession to the throne of
                Russia of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander III.</name>,
                who had long enjoyed the reputation of being systematically hostile to Germans,
                produce a rupture, as was expected. Six months after <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">his father</name>'s
                death, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the young tsar</name> met <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">the old kaiser</name> at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gdańsk">Danzig</name>
                                <pb n="946" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0946.png"/> (September 1881), and
                some progress was made towards a complete renewal of the traditional friendship.
                Immediately afterwards a further step was taken towards re-establishing the old
                state of things with regard also to Austria. On his return to St Petersburg, <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander III.</name> remembered that he had received some time previously a

                    Joseph</name>, and he now replied to it very cordially, referring to the meeting

                  describing <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the emperor

                            <p>The removal of all immediate danger of a Franco-Russian alliance did not prevent
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> from strengthening in other ways the diplomatic position of
                Germany, and the result of nis efforts soon became apparent in the alliance of Italy
                with the two central powers. Ever since the Franco-German War of 1870-71, and more
                especially since the congress of Berlin in 1878, the Italian government had shown
                itself restless and undecided in its foreign policy. As it was to France that Italy
                owed her emancipation from Austrian rule, it seemed natural that the two countries
                should remain allies, but anything like cordial co-operation was prevented by
                conflicting interests and hostile feeling. The French did not consider the
                acquisition of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy">Savoy</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nice">Nice</name> a sufficient compensation for the assistance they had given to the
                cause of Italian unity, and they did not know, or did not care to remember, that
                their own government was greatly to blame for the passive attitude of Italy in the
                hour of their great national misfortunes. On the other hand, a considerable amount
                of bitterness against France had been gradually accumulating in the hearts of the
                Italians. As far back as the end of the war of 1859, popular opinion had been freely
                expressed against <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon III.</name>, because he had failed to keep his promise of liberating
                  Italy <quote>" from the Alps to the Adriatic."</quote>
                                </ref> The feeling was revived and intensified when it became known that he was
                opposing the annexation of central and southern Italy, and that he obtained <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy">Savoy</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nice">Nice</name> as the price of
                partly withdrawing his opposition. Subsequently, in the war of 1866, he was supposed
                to have insulted Italy by making her conclude peace with Austria, on the basis of
                the cession of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venetia_(region)">Venetia</name>, before she could wipe out the humiliation of her defeats at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sommacampagna">Custozza</name> and
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vis_(island)">Lissa</name>.
                Then came the French protection of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Pius_IX">the pope</name>'s temporal power as
                a constant source of irritation, producing occasional explosions of violent
                hostility, as when the new <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antoine_Alphonse_Chassepot">Chassepot</name>
                rifles were announced to have <q>" worked wonders "</q> among the Garibaldians at
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mentana">Mentana</name>. When
                  <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_French_Empire">the Second Empire</name> was replaced by <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">the Republic</name>, the
                relations did not improve. French statesmen of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adolphe_Thiers">Thiers</name> school had always
                condemned the imperial policy of permitting and even encouraging the creation of
                large, powerful states on the French frontiers, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adolphe_Thiers">Thiers</name> himself publicly
                attributed to this policy the misfortunes of his country. With regard to Italy, he
                said openly that he regretted what had been done, though he had no intention of
                undoing it. The first part of this statement was carefully noted in Italy, and the
                latter part was accepted with scepticism. In any case his hand might perhaps be
                forced, for in the first <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_of_Deputies_of_France">republican
                  chamber</name> the monarchical and clerical element was very strong, and it
                persistently attempted to get something done in favour of the temporal power. Even
                when the party of the Left undertook the direction of affairs in 1876, the
                government did not become anti-clerical in its foreign policy, and Italian statesmen
                resigned themselves to a position of political isolation. The position had its
                advantages. Events in the Balkan Peninsula foreshadowed a great European war, and it
                seemed that in the event of Europe's being divided into two hostile camps, Italy
                might have the honour and the advantage of regulating the balance of power. By
                maintaining good relations with all her neighbours and carefully avoiding all
                inconvenient entanglements, she might come forward at the critical moment and
                dictate her own terms to either of the contending parties, or offer her services to
                the highest bidder. This Machiavellian policy did not give the expected results.
                Being friends with everybody in a general way may be the best course for an old,
                conservative country which desires merely the maintenance of the <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                    <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                </foreign>, but it does not secure the energetic diplomatic support required by a
                young enterprising state which wishes to increase its territory and influence. At
                the congress of Berlin, when several of the powers got territorial acquisitions,
                Italy got nothing. The Italians, who were in the habit of assuming, almost as a
                matter of principle, that from all European complications they had a right to obtain
                some tangible advantage, were naturally disappointed, and they attributed their
                misfortune to their political isolation. The policy of the free hand consequently
                fell into disrepute, and the desire for a close, efficient alliance revived. But
                with what power or powers should an alliance be made ? The remnants of the old party
                of action, who still carried the <foreign xml:lang="it"/> banner, had an answer
                ready. They recommended that alliances should be concluded with a view to wresting
                from Austria <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Province_of_Trento">the Trentino</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trieste">Trieste</name>, with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dalmatia">Dalmatia</name>, perhaps, into the
                bargain. On the other hand, the Conservatives and the Moderates considered that the
                question of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Province_of_Trento">the Trentino</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trieste">Trieste</name> was much less important
                than that of political influence in the Mediterranean. A strong Austria was
                required, it was said, to bar the way of Russia to the Adriatic, and France must not
                be allowed to pursue unchecked her policy of transforming the Mediterranean into a
                French lake. Considerations of this kind led naturally to the conclusion that Italy
                should draw closer to the powers of central Europe. So the question appeared from
                the standpoint of <q>

                and a subsequent exchange of notes were kept strictly secret, the Italian government
                soon got wind of the affair, and it was at first much alarmed. It considered, in
                common with Italians generally, that <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tunisia">Tunis</name>, on the ground of historic
                right and of national interests, should be reserved for Italy, and that an extension
                of French territory in that direction would destroy, to the detriment of Italy, the
                balance of power in the Mediterranean. These apprehensions were calmed for a time by
                assurances given to the Italian ambassador in Paris. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Léon_Gambetta">M. Gambetta</name> assured <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Enrico_Cialdini">General
                  Cialdini</name> that he had no intention of making Italy an irreconcilable enemy

                declared, on his word of honour, that so long as he remained minister of foreign
                affairs nothing of the sort would be done by France without a previous understanding
                with the cabinet of Rome. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Henry_Waddington">M. Waddington</name>
                honourably kept his word, but his successor did not consider himself bound by the

                himself, in defiance of what he had said to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Enrico_Cialdini">Cialdini</name>, was
                congratulating <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Ferry">Jules Ferry</name> on having restored France to her place among the nations, the
                Italians were trying to smother their indignation and to discover some means of
                retrieving what they had lost. The only remedy seemed to be to secure foreign
                alliances, and there was now no hesitation as to where they should be sought. Simple
                people in Italy imagined that if an alliance had been concluded sooner with Germany
                and Austria, these powers would have prevented France from trampling on the sacred
                interests of Italy. This idea was entirely erroneous, because Austria had little or
                no interest in the Tunisian Question, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> was not at all
                sorry to see France embark on an enterprise which distracted her attention from
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alsace">Alsace</name>- <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lotharingia">Lorraine</name> and
                removed all danger of a Franco-Italian alliance. The illusion, however, had a
                powerful influence on Italian public opinion. The government was now urged to
                conclude without further delay an alliance with the central powers, and the
                recommendation was not unwelcome to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Umberto_I_of_Italy">the king</name>, because most
                of the Italian Gallophils had anti-dynastic and republican tendencies, and he was
                naturally disposed to draw nearer to governments which proclaimed themselves the
                defenders of monarchical institutions and the opponents of revolutionary agitation.
                After protracted negotiations, in which Italy tried in vain to secure protection for
                her own separate interests in the Mediterranean, defensive <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">treaties of
                  alliance</title> were concluded with the cabinets of Vienna and Berlin in May
                1882. Though the Italian statesmen did not secure by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">these treaties</title>
                all they wanted, they felt that <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861–1946)">the kingdom</name>

                in the summer of 1883, that the evil results of the congress of Berlin might be

                was disquieted by the continuance of the Nihilist agitation, and was not averse from
                drawing closer to the conservative powers; and as he desired tranquillity for some
                time in the Balkan Peninsula, he was glad to have security that his rival would do
                nothing in that part of the world without a previous understanding. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_de_Giers">M. de

                and on the 21st of March 1884 a formal document was signed in Berlin. About six
                months later, in the month of September, the three emperors met at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skierniewice">Skiernevice</name> and

                chief aims evidently were to paralyse Russia by yoking her to Germany and Austria,
                to isolate France, and to realize his old scheme of holding the balance between
                Russia and Austria in the Balkan Peninsula. With a view to attaining the first two
                objects it was stipulated that if any one of the three powers were forced to make
                war on a fourth power, the two other contracting parties should observe a benevolent
                neutrality towards their ally. If we may believe a well-informed Russian authority,
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> wished it to be understood that in the event of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of the powers being at war with a fourth, the stipulation about
                benevolent neutrality should still hold good, but <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander III.</name>
                objected, on the ground that he could not remain a passive spectator of a duel in
                which France would be confronted by two antagonists. In his third object <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>
                was successful, for it was expressly laid down that in all cases of a disagreement
                between two of the parties in the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula, the third power
                should decide between them. This meant, of course, that in all discussions between
                Russia and Austria, the two great rivals in the Eastern Question, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>
                should always have a casting vote. In return for all this, Russia obtained two small

                fleet, as he had done in 1878, when the Russian army was before Constantinople ;

                  League</name> had all the organic defects of its predecessor, and was destined to
                be still more shortlived. The claims of Russia and Austria might be reconcilable in
                theory, but in practice they were sure to conflict; and however much <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>
                might try to play the part of an honest broker, he was certain to be suspected of
                opposing Russia and favouring Austria. It was therefore only during a period of
                political stagnation in south-eastern Europe that the arrangement could work
                smoothly. The political stagnation did not last long. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince Alexander
                  of Bulgaria</name> had for some time been fretting under the high-handed
                interference of the Russian agents in the principality, and had begun to oppose
                systematically what the Russians considered their legitimate influence. Relations
                between Sofia and St Petersburg had consequently become strained, when a crisis was
                suddenly brought about by the revolution of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plovdiv">Philippopolis</name> in September 1885.
                The conspirators arrested and expelled <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gavril_Krastevich">the governor-general</name>,
                who had been appointed by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name> with the assent
                of the powers, and at the same time proclaimed the union of the autonomous province
                of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eastern_Rumelia">Eastern
                  Rumelia</name> with the principality of Bulgaria, in defiance of the stipulations

                  Berlin</title>. The revolution had been effected with the connivance and approval
                of the regularly accredited Russian agents in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plovdiv">Philippopolis</name>, but it had not
                received the sanction of the Russian government, and was resented as a new act of
                insubordination on the part of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince
                  Alexander</name>. When he arrived in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plovdiv">Philippopolis</name> and accepted the
                declaration of union, the cabinet of St Petersburg protested against any such
                infraction of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878)">the
                  Berlin treaty</title>, and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> prepared to send
                an army into the province. It was restrained from taking this step by the
                ambassadors in Constantinople, so that an armed conflict between Turks and
                Bulgarians was prevented; but no sooner had the Bulgarians been relieved from this
                danger on their eastern frontier, than they were attacked from the west by the
                Servians, who were determined to get ample compensation for any advantage which the
                Bulgarians might obtain. The Bulgarian army defeated the Servians at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slivnitsa">Slivnitza</name>
                (November 19-20, 1885), and was marching on Belgrade when its advance was stopped
                and an armistice arranged by the energetic intervention of the Austrian government.
                Following the example of the Servians, the Greeks were preparing <pb n="948" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0948.png"/> to exact territorial compensation
                likewise ; but as their mobilization was a slow process, the powers had time to
                restrain them from entering on active hostilities, first by an ultimatum (April 26,
                1886), and afterwards by a blockade of their ports (May 1886). By that time, thanks
                to the intervention of the powers, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Bucharest_(1886)">a peace</title>
                between Bulgaria and Servia had been signed at Bucharest (March 3); and with regard

                  Rumelia</name> a compromise had been effected by which the formal union with the

                was appointed governor-general of the province for a term of five years. This was in
                reality union in disguise.</p>
                            <p>The diplomatic solution of the problem averted the danger of a European war, but it
                left a great deal of dissatisfaction, which soon produced new troubles. Not only had
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince
                  Alexander</name> escaped punishment for his insubordination to Russia, but he and
                the anti-Russian party among the Bulgarians had obtained a decided success. This
                could not well be tolerated. Before six months had passed (August 21, 1886) <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince Alexander</name> was kidnapped by conspirators in his palace at Sofia and
                conveyed secretly to Russian <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name>. As soon as the
                incident was reported to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">the
                  prince</name> was released, and he at once returned to Sofia, where a
                counter-revolution had been effected in his favour; but he considered his position
                untenable, and formally abdicated. A fortnight after his departure <name type="person">General Kaulbars</name> arrived from St Petersburg with instructions
                from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name> to restore order in accordance with Russian interests. In St
                Petersburg it was supposed that <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulgarians">the Bulgarian people</name> were
                still devoted to Russia, and that they were ready to rise against and expel the
                politicians of the Nationalist party led by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefan_Stambolov">Stambolof</name>. <name type="person">General Kaulbars</name> accordingly made a tour in the country and
                delivered speeches to the assembled multitudes, but <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefan_Stambolov">Stambolof</name>'s political
                organization counteracted all his efforts, and on the 20th of November he left
                Bulgaria and took the Russian consuls with him. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefan_Stambolov">Stambolof</name> maintained his
                position, suppressed energetically several insurrectionary movements, and succeeded
                in getting <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_I_of_Bulgaria">Prince Ferdinand of
                  Coburg</name> elected prince (July 7, 1887), in spite of the opposition of Russia,
                who put forward as candidate a Russian subject, <name type="person">Prince Nicholas

                was not officially recognized by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name> and the powers,
                but he continued to reign under the direction of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefan_Stambolov">Stambolof</name>, and the
                Russian government, passively accepting the accomplished facts, awaited patiently a

                            <p>These events in the Balkan Peninsula necessarily affected the mutual relations of

                  League</name>. Austria could not remain a passive and disinterested spectator of
                the action of Russia in Bulgaria. Her agents had given a certain amount of support
                to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince
                  Alexander</name> in his efforts to emancipate himself from Russian domination; and
                when the prince was kidnapped and induced to abdicate, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gustav_Kálnoky">Count Kálnoky</name> had not
                concealed his intention of opposing further aggression. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> resisted the
                pressure brought to bear on him from several quarters in favour of the anti-Russian
                party in Bulgaria, but he was suspected by the Russians of siding with Austria and
                secretly encouraging the opposition to Russian influence. This revived the hatred
                against him which had been created by his pro-Austrian leanings after the
                Russo-Turkish War. The feeling was assiduously fomented by the Russian press,
                especially by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mikhail_Katkov">M. Katkoff</name>, the editor of the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moskovskie_Vedomosti">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Moscow Gazette</hi>
                                </title>, who exercised great influence on public opinion and had personal relations
                with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander III.</name> On the 31st of July 1886, three weeks before the kidnapping
                of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince
                  Alexander</name>, he had begun a regular journalistic campaign against Germany,
                and advocated strongly a new orientation of Russian policy. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_de_Giers">M. de Giers</name>, minister
                of foreign affairs, was openly attacked as a partisan of the German alliance, and

                  "</q> were compared to the humiliating journeys of the old Russian grandprinces to

                  Horde</name> in the time of the Tatar domination. The moment had come, it was
                said, for Russia to emancipate herself from German diplomatic thraldom, and for this
                purpose a <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                </foreign> with France was suggested. The idea was well received by the public, and
                it seemed to be not unpalatable to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name>, for the
                  <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moskovskie_Vedomosti">

                                </title> was allowed to continue its attacks on <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_de_Giers">M. de Giers</name>'s policy of
                maintaining <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">the German
                  alliance</name>. In Berlin such significant facts could not fail to produce
                uneasiness, because one of the chief aims of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s policy had
                always been to prevent a Russo-French <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                                    <hi rend="italic">entente cordiale</hi>
                                </foreign>. The German press were instructed to refute the arguments of their
                Russian colleagues, and to prove that if Russia had really lost her influence in the
                Balkan Peninsula, the fact was due to the blunders of her own diplomacy. The
                controversy did not produce at once a serious estrangement between the two cabinets,
                but it marked the beginning of a period of vacillation on the part of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander
                  III.</name> When the treaty of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skierniewice">Skiernevice</name> was about to
                expire in 1887, he positively refused to renew <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the Three Emperors'
                  League</name>, but he consented to make, without the cognizance of Austria, a
                secret treaty of alliance with Germany for three years. Not satisfied with this
                guarantee against the danger of a Franco-Russian alliance, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> caused attacks
                to be made in the press on Russian credit, which was rapidly gaining a footing on
                the Paris bourse, and he imprudently showed his hand by prohibiting <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichsbank">the
                  Reichsbank</name> from accepting Russian securities as guarantees. From that
                moment <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name>'s attitude changed. All his dormant suspicions of German policy
                revived. When he passed through Berlin in November 1887, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had a long
                audience, in which he defended himself with his customary ability, but <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander</name> remained unmoved in his conviction that the German government
                had systematically opposed Russian interests, and had paralysed Russian action in
                the Balkan Peninsula for the benefit of Austria ; and he failed to understand the
                ingenious theory put forward by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">the German chancellor</name>,
                that two powers might have a severe economic struggle without affecting their
                political relations. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had to
                recognize that, for the moment at least, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the Three Emperors'
                  League</name>, which had served his purposes so well, could not be resuscitated,
                but he had still a certain security against the hostility of Russia in the secret
                treaty. Soon, however, this link was also to be broken. When the treaty expired in
                1890 it was not renewed. By that time <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had been
                dismissed, and he subsequently reproached his successor, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_von_Caprivi">Count Caprivi</name>, with not
                having renewed it, but in reality <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_von_Caprivi">Count Caprivi</name> was not to
                blame. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander III.</name> was determined not to renew the alliance, and was already
                gravitating slowly towards an understanding with France.</p>

                            <p>No treaty or formal defensive engagement of any kind existed between Russia and
                France, but it was already tolerably certain that in the event of a great war the
                two nations would be found fighting on the same side, and the military authorities
                in both countries felt that if no arrangements were made beforehand for concerted
                action,— such arrangements having been long ago completed by the powers composing
                  <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">the Triple Alliance</name>,— they would begin the campaign at a great
                disadvantage. This was perfectly understood by both governments; and after some
                hesitation on both sides, Generals <name type="person">Vannovski</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolai_Obruchev">Obruchev</name>,
                on the one side, and Generals <name type="person">Saussier</name>, <name type="person">Miribel</name> and <name type="person">Boisdeffre</name> on the
                other, were permitted to discuss plans of co-operation. At the same time a large
                quantity of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Lebel">Lebel</name> rifles were manufactured in France for the Russian army, and the
                secret of making smokeless powder was communicated to the Russian military
                authorities. The French government wished to go further and conclude a defensive
                alliance, but <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name> was
                reluctant to bind himself with a government which had so little stability, and which
                might be induced to provoke a war with Germany by the prospect of Russian support.
                Even the military convention was not formally ratified until 1894. The enthusiastic
                partisans of the alliance flattered themselves that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name>'s
                reluctance had been overcome, when he received very graciously <name type="person">Admiral Gervais</name> and his officers during the visit of the French fleet to

                the balance of power in Europe was seriously disturbed. Russia inadvertently
                provoked a struggle with Japan which made such a drain on her energies and material
                resources that her political influence in Europe necessarily suffered a partial
                eclipse. Thus <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">the Triple

                danger for herself, and naturally looked about for some diplomatic support to
                replace that of Russia, which had lost much of its value. From her uncomfortable
                isolation there were only two possible exits—a <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                </foreign> with England. Both of these demanded sacrifices. The former required a

                fifteen years <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenians">the
                  Armenians</name> continued to hope for the efficacious intervention of their
                protectors, but when their patience became exhausted and the question seemed in
                danger of being forgotten, they determined to bring it again to the front. Some of
                them confined themselves to agitating abroad, especially in England, in favour of
                the cause, whilst others made preparations for exciting an insurrectionary movement
                in Constantinople and Asia Minor. These latter knew very well that an insurrection
                could be suppressed by the Turkish government without much difficulty, but they
                hoped that the savage measures of repression which the Turks were sure to employ
                might lead to the active intervention of Europe and ensure their liberation from
                Turkish rule, as the famous <q>"atrocities"</q> of 1876 had led to the political
                emancipation of Bulgaria. In due course—1895-1896—the expected atrocities took
                place, in the form of wholesale massacres in Constantinople and various towns of
                Asia Minor. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">The
                  sultan</name> was subjected to diplomatic pressure and threatened with more
                efficient means of coercion. In the diplomatic campaign England took the lead, and
                was warmly supported by Italy, but Germany, Austria and France showed themselves
                lukewarm, not to say indifferent, and Russia, departing from her traditional policy
                of protecting the Christians of Turkey, vetoed the employment of force for
                extracting concessions from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name>. In these

                confined itself to making a few reforms on paper, which were never carried out. Thus
                the last state of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenians">the Armenians</name> was worse than the first, but the so-called European concert
                was maintained, and the danger of a great European war was averted.</p>

                began a Panhellenic agitation, and took advantage of one of the periodical
                insurrections in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">Crete</name> to further its projects. In February 1897 <name type="institution">the Cretan revolutionary committee</name> proclaimed the annexation of the island

                  Hellenic kingdom</name>, and a contingent of Greek regular troops landed near

                command of <name type="person">Colonel Vassos</name> to take possession of the
                island in the name of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_I_of_Greece">King George</name>. The
                powers, objecting to this arbitrary proceeding, immediately occupied <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chania">Canea</name> with a mixed
                force from the ships of war which were there at the time, and summoned the Greek
                government to withdraw its troops. The summons was disregarded, and the whole of the
                Greek army was mobilized on the frontier of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly">Thessaly</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epirus_(region)">Epirus</name>. In consequence of

                the 17th of April, and the short campaign ended in the defeat of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name>. The powers intervened
                to put an end to the hostilities, and after prolonged negotiations a peace was
                concluded by which Greece had to consent to a strategical rectification of frontier
                and to pay a war indemnity of £4,000,000. Thus a second time the European concert
                acted effectually in the interests of peace, but it did not stand the strain of the
                subsequent efforts to solve the Cretan Question. Finding the Turks less conciliatory
                after their military success, and being anxious to remain in cordial relations with

                and the question received a temporary solution by the appointment of <name type="person">Prince George</name>, second son of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_I_of_Greece">the king of Greece</name>, as

                            <p>The conflicting desires of several of the powers to obtain colonial possessions in
                various parts of the world, and to forestall their competitors in the act of taking
                possession, were bound to introduce complications in which England, as the greatest
                  <pb n="950" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0950.png"/> of colonial powers,
                would generally be involved ; and as the unappropriated portions of the earth's
                surface at the beginning of the period under discussion were to be found chiefly in
                Africa, it was in the Dark Continent that the conflicts of interests mostly took
                place. England's chief competitors were France and Germany. Her traditional policy,
                except in the south of the continent, where the conditions of soil and climate were
                favourable to European colonists, had been purely commercial. She had refrained from
                annexation of territory, as involving too much expenditure and responsibility, and
                confined her protection to the trading stations on the coast. When France came into
                the field this policy had to be abandoned. The policy of France was also commercial
                in a certain sense, but the methods she adopted were very different. She endeavoured
                to bring under her authority, by annexation or the establishment of protectorates,
                the largest possible extent of territory, in order to increase her trade by a system
                of differential tariffs ; she encroached on the hinterland of British settlements,
                and endeavoured to direct artificially the native inland trade towards her own
                ports. A glance at the map of the African West Coast will suffice to show the
                success with which this policy was carried out. When the British government awoke to
                the danger, all that could be done was to prevent further encroachments by likewise
                annexing territory. The result is shown in the article AFRICA : § 5. In her dealings
                with France about the partition of Africa, England was generally conciliatory, but
                she was always inflexible in guarding carefully the two entrances to the
                Mediterranean. There was, therefore, a permanent danger of conflict in Egypt and
                Morocco. When England in 1882 considered it necessary to suppress the Arabi
                insurrection, she invited France to co-operate, but the French government declined,
                and left the work to be done by England alone. England had no intention of occupying
                the country permanently, but she had to take precautions against the danger of
                French occupation after her withdrawal, and these precautions were embodied in an
                Anglo-Turkish convention signed at Constantinople in May 1887. France prevented the
                ratification of the convention by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name>, with the
                result that the British occupation has been indefinitely prolonged. She still clung
                persistently, however, to the hope of obtaining a predominant position in the valley
                of the Nile, and she tried to effect her purpose by gaining a firm foothold on the
                upper course of the river. The effort which she made in 1898 to attain this end, by
                simultaneously despatching the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Marchand">Marchand</name> mission
                from her <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Congo">Congo</name> possessions and inciting <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menelik_II_of_Ethiopia">the emperor Menelek of
                  Abyssinia</name> to send a force from the east to join hands with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Marchand">Major
                  Marchand</name> at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kodok">Fashoda</name>, was defeated by the overthrow of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdallahi_ibn_Muhammad">the Khalifa</name> and
                the British occupation of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khartoum">Khartum</name>. For a few days the two
                nations seemed on the brink of war, but the French government, receiving no
                encouragement from St Petersburg, consented to withdraw the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Marchand">Marchand</name> mission,
                and a convention was signed defining the respective spheres of influence of the two
                countries.</p>
                            <p>In Morocco the rivalry between the two powers was less acute but not less
                persistent and troublesome. France aspired to incorporate the sultanate with her
                north African possessions, whilst England had commercial interests to defend and was
                firmly resolved to prevent France from getting unfettered possession of the southern
                coast of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strait_of_Gibraltar">the Straits of Gibraltar</name>. As in Egypt, so in Morocco the dangers of
                conflict were averted, in 1904, by a general agreement, which enabled France to
                carry out in Morocco, as far as England was concerned, her policy of pacific
                penetration, but debarred her from erecting fortifications in the vicinity of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strait_of_Gibraltar">the
                  straits</name>. Germany thereafter strongly opposed French claims in Morocco, but
                after a period of great tension, and the holding of an ineffectual conference at
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algeciras">Algeciras</name> in
                1906, an understanding was come to in 1909 (see MOROCCO : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>).</p>
                            <p>With Germany likewise, from 1880 onwards, England had some diplomatic difficulties
                regarding the partition of Africa, but they never reached a very acute phase, and
                were ultimately settled by mutual concessions. By <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heligoland-Zanzibar_Treaty">the
                  arrangement</title> of 1890, in which several of the outstanding questions were
                solved, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heligoland">Heligoland</name> ceded to Germany in return for concessions in East Africa. A
                conflict of interests in the southern Pacific was amicably arranged by the
                Anglo-German convention of April 1886, in which a line of demarcation was drawn
                between the respective spheres of influence in the islands to the north and east of
                the Australian continent, and by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tripartite_Convention_(1899)">the convention of

                            <p>In Asia the tendencies of the European powers to territorial expansion, and their
                desire to secure new markets for their trade and industry, have affected from time
                to time their mutual relations. More than once England and Russia have had disputes
                about the limits of their respective spheres of influence in central Asia, but the
                causes of friction have steadily diminished as the work of frontier delimitation has
                advanced. The important agreement of 1872-1873 was supplemented by the protocol of
                the 22nd of July 1887 and <title>the Pamir delimitation of 1895</title>, so that the
                Russo-Afghan frontier, which is the dividing line between the Russian and British
                spheres of influence, has now been carried right up to the frontier of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Late_Imperial_China">the
                  Chinese empire</name>. The delimitation of the English and French spheres of
                influence in Asia has also progressed. In 1885 France endeavoured to get a footing
                on <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ayeyarwady_River">the Upper
                  Irrawaddy</name>, the hinterland of British Burma, and England replied in the
                following year by annexing the dominions of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thibaw_Min">King Thebaw</name>, including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shan_States">the Shan States</name>
                as far east as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mekong">the
                  Mekong</name>. Thereupon France pushed her Indo-Chinese frontier westwards, and in
                1893 made an attack on <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thailand">the kingdom of Siam</name>, which very
                nearly brought about a conflict with England. After prolonged negotiations an
                arrangement was reached and embodied in a formal treaty (January 1896), which
                clearly foreshadows a future partition between the two powers, but guarantees the
                independence of the central portion of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thailand">the kingdom</name>, the Valley of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chao_Phraya_River">the Menam</name>,
                as a buffer-state. Farther north, in eastern China, the aggressive tendencies and
                mutual rivalries of the European powers have produced a problem of a much more
                complicated kind. Firstly Germany, then Russia, next England, and finally France
                took portions of Chinese territory, under the thin disguise of long leases. They
                thereby excited in the Chinese population and government an intense anti-foreign
                feeling, which produced the Boxer movement and culminated in the attack on the
                foreign legations at Pekin in the summer of 1900. (See CHINA : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>.)</p>
                            <p>In 1890-1901 the relations of the European powers were disturbed by the Boer War in
                South Africa. In nearly every country of Europe popular feeling was much excited
                against England, and in certain influential quarters the idea was entertained of
                utilizing this feeling for the formation of a coalition against <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Empire">the British
                  empire</name> ; but in view of the decided attitude assumed by the British
                government, and the loyal enthusiasm displayed by the colonies, no foreign
                government ventured to take the initiative of intervention, and it came gradually to
                be recognized that no European state had any tangible interest in prolonging the
                independence and maladministration of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boer_Republics">the Boer republics</name>.</p>
                            <p>One permanent factor in the history of Europe after the war of 1870-71 was the
                constant increase of armaments by all the great powers, and the proportionate
                increase of taxation. The fact made such an impression on the young emperor of
                Russia, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_II_of_Russia">Nicholas II.</name>, that he invited the powers to consider whether the further
                increase of the burdens thereby imposed on the nations might not be arrested by
                mutual agreement; and a conference for this purpose was convened at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Hague">the Hague</name> (May 18-
                July 29, 1899), but the desirable object in view was not attained. (See ARBITRATION,

                second, which met in 1907, did much to fulfil the expectations of those who hoped
                for the establishment of a system which should guarantee the world against the
                disasters of war, they undoubtedly tended to create a strong public opinion in
                favour of peaceful methods in the solution of international problems which has not
                been without its effect. Any attempt to organize the concert of the powers must
                always <pb n="951" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0951.png"/> fail, as it failed
                in the early part of the 19th century, so long as the spirit of national and racial
                rivalry is stronger than the consciousness of common interests ; and the early years
                of the 20th century showed no diminution, but rather an accentuation of this
                rivalry. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration">The court of

                  VII.</name>, which did so much to prevent misunderstandings likely to lead to war,
                resulted from 1903 onwards in a series of arbitration treaties between Great Britain
                and other powers which guaranteed <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration">the Hague
                  court</name> an effective activity in such matters. But more perilous issues,
                involving deep-seated antagonisms, have continued to be dealt with by the methods of
                the old diplomacy backed by the armed force of the powers. How far the final
                solution of such problems has been helped or hindered by the general reluctance to
                draw the sword must for some time to come remain an open question. Certainly, during
                the early years of the 20th century, many causes of difference which a hundred years
                earlier would assuredly have led to war, were settled, or at least shelved, by
                diplomacy. Of these the questions of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">Crete</name>, of Armenia, and of contested
                claims in Africa have already been mentioned. Other questions of general interest
                which might have led to war, but which found a peaceful solution, were those of the
                separation of Norway and Sweden, and the rivalry of the powers in the northern seas.
                In October 1905 Sweden formally recognized the separate existence of Norway (see
                NORWAY : <hi rend="italic">History</hi> and SWEDEN : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>). On the 23rd of April 1908 were signed the <q>" Declarations "</q> ;

                                </foreign> in that sea ; the other—to which Great Britain, France, Germany, Denmark,
                Sweden and Holland were the parties—sanctioned a similar principle in regard to the
                North Sea. These were followed, in June of the same year, by two agreements intended
                to apply the same principles to the southern European waters, signed by France and
                Spain and Great Britain and Spain respectively. Another agreement, that signed
                between Russia and Great Britain in 1907 for the delimitation of their spheres of
                influence in Persia and the northern borders of the Indian empire, though having no
                direct relation to European affairs, exercised considerable influence upon them by
                helping to restore the international prestige of Russia, damaged by the disasters of
                the war with Japan and the internal disturbances that followed. The new cordial
                understanding between the British and Russian governments was cemented by the
                meeting of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom">King Edward

                            <p>More perilous to European peace, however, than any of these issues was the
                perennial unrest in Macedonia, which threatened sooner or later to open up the whole
                Eastern Question once more in its acutest form. The situation was due to the
                internecine struggle of the rival Balkan races— <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">Greek</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulgarians">Bulgarian</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serbs">Servian</name>—to secure the right to the
                reversion of territories not yet derelict. But behind these lesser issues loomed the
                great secular rivalries of the powers, and beyond these again the vast unknown
                forces of the Mahommedan world, ominously stirring. The very vastness of the perils
                involved in any attempt at a definitive settlement compelled the powers to accept a
                compromise which, it was hoped, would restore tolerable conditions in the wretched
                country. But the <title>

                diplomatic pressure of the great powers, did not produce the effects hoped for. The

                equally hideous, if less wholesale, reprisals by Bulgarian bands, grew rather than
                diminished, and reached its climax in the early months of 1908. The usefulness of

                authorities in the restoration of order, was from the outset crippled by the passive
                obstruction of the Turkish government. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">The sultan</name>, indeed, could
                hardly be blamed for watching with a certain cynical indifference the mutiial
                slaughter of those " Christians" whose avowed ideal was the overthrow of Mahommedan
                rule, nor could he be expected to desire the smooth working of a system against
                which he had protested as a violation of his sovereign rights. In 1908 the powers
                were still united in bringing pressure to bear on <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> to make the

                            <p>Such was the condition of affairs when in October 1908 the revolution in Turkey
                altered the whole situation. The easy and apparently complete victory of the Young
                Turks, and young the re-establishment without a struggle of the constitution which
                had been in abeyance since 1876, took the whole world by surprise, and not least
                those who believed themselves to be most intimately acquainted with the conditions
                prevailing in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman empire</name>. The
                question of the Near East seemed in fair way of settlement by the action of
                conflicting races themselves, who in the enthusiasm of newfound freedom appeared
                ready to forget their ancient internecine feuds and to fraternize on the common
                ground of constitutional liberty (see TURKEY : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>). By
                the European powers the proclamation of the constitution was received, at least
                outwardly, with unanimous approval, general admiration being expressed for the
                singular moderation and self-restraint shown by the Turkish leaders and people.
                Whatever views, however, may have been openly expressed, or secretly held, as to the
                revolution so far as it affected <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman empire</name> itself,
                there could be no doubt that its effects on the general situation in Europe would be
                profound. These effects were not slow in revealing themselves. On the 5th of October
                  <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_I_of_Bulgaria">Prince Ferdinand of Coburg</name> proclaimed himself king <foreign xml:lang="bg">

                  Joseph</name> issued a rescript announcing the annexation of Bosnia and

                (see BULGARIA : <hi rend="italic">History</hi> and BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: <hi rend="italic">History</hi>). Whatever cogent reasons there may have been for
                altering the status of these countries in view of the changed conditions in Turkey,
                there could be no doubt that the method employed was a violation of the public law
                of Europe. By <ref>

                success of this <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                to meet. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alois_Lexa_von_Aehrenthal">Baron von
                  Aehrenthal</name>, himself more Slav than German, in spite of his name, had served
                a long apprenticeship in diplomacy at Belgrade and St Petersburg; he knew how fully
                he could rely upon the weakness of Russia, and that if Russian Pan-Slav sentiment
                could be cowed, he need fear nothing from the resentment of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serbs">the Servians</name>. He was strong, too,
                in the moral and—in case of need—the material support of Germany. With Germany
                behind her, Austria-Hungary had little to fear from the opposition of the powers of

                justified by the event. For months, indeed, Europe seemed on the verge of a general
                war. During the autumn the nationalist excitement in Servia and Montenegro rose to
                feverheat, and Austria responded by mobilizing her forces on the frontiers and
                arming the Catholic <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnians">Bosnians</name> as a precaution against a rising of their Orthodox countrymen.
                Only the winter seemed to stand between Europe and a war bound to become general,
                and men looked forward with apprehension to the melting of the snows. It is too
                early as yet to write the history of the diplomatic activities by which this
                disaster was avoided. Their general <pb n="952" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0952.png"/> outline, however, is clear enough.
                The protests of Turkey at a violation of treaty rights, doubly resented as likely to
                damage the prestige of the new constitutional regime, were sympathetically received
                by the powers of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Entente">the triple <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                  Berlin</title> necessitated by the new conditions in Turkey; the right of Austria-

                and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_I_of_Bulgaria">Prince Ferdinand</name>'s title of king were meantime refused recognition. In the
                assertion of these principles Great Britain, Russia and France were united. Germany,
                on the other hand, maintained an attitude of reserve, though diplomatically

                  Aehrenthal</name>'s ambition had o'erleaped itself. The reluctance of the Russian
                government, conscious of its military and political weakness, to take extreme
                measures seemed likely to be overborne by the Pan-Slav enthusiasm of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russians">the Russian

                greater than that on which he had calculated. At this point Germany, conscious
                throughout of holding the key to the situation, intervened with effect. Towards the
                end of March 1909 the German ambassador at St Petersburg, armed with an autograph
                letter from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor">the emperor William
                  II.</name>, had an interview with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name>. What were
                the arguments he used is not known ; but the most powerful are supposed to have been
                the German forces which had been mobilized on the Polish frontier. In any case, the
                result was immediate and startling. Russia, without previous discussion with her
                allies, dissociated herself from the views she had hitherto held in common with
                them, and accepted the German-Austrian standpoint. All question of a conference was
                now at an end ; and all that the powers most friendly to Turkey could do was to
                persuade her to make the best of a bad bargain. The Ottoman government, preoccupied
                with the internal questions which were to issue in the abortive attempt at
                counter-revolution in April, was in no condition to resist friendly or unfriendly
                pressure. The principle of a money payment in compensation for the shadowy rights of

                and international issues involved. The whole conception of an effective concert of
                Europe, or of the World, based on the supposed sacred obligation of treaties and the
                validity of international law, was revealed, suddenly and brutally, as the baseless
                fabric of a dream. The most momentous outcome of the international debates caused by

                                </ref> In Great Britain, especially, public opinion was quick to grasp this truth.
                It was realized that it was the immense armed power of Germany that had made her the
                arbiter in a question vitally affecting the interests of all Europe. Germany alone
                emerged from the crisis with prestige enormously enhanced ; for without her
                intervention Austria could not have resisted the pressure of the powers. The cry for

                revelation by the first lord of the admiralty (April 1909) of Germany's accelerated
                activity in naval construction, showed that public opinion had been thoroughly
                awakened to the necessity of maintaining for Great Britain her maritime supremacy,
                on which not only her position in Europe but the existence of her over-sea empire

                  the value of its various parts is therefore that of the historians responsible for

                  or obscure sources which would otherwise have remained closed to the general
                  reader. It also contains essays by notable modern scholars on the principal epochs
                  and tendencies of the world's history, the texts of a certain number of treaties,
                  etc., not included as yet in other collections, and comprehensive bibliographies.

                  borne in mind, however, that these represent but a fraction of the unpublished

                  revealing fresh sources, throwing new light on old problems, and not seldom
                  upsetting conclusions long established as final. For these latest developments of

                            <gloss target="#HISTORY" rend="unmarked">The word " history " is used in two senses.
                It may mean either the record of events, or events themselves.</gloss> Originally
              (see below) limited to inquiry and statement, it was only in comparatively modern
              times that the meaning of the word was extended to include the phenomena which form or
              might form their subject. It was perhaps by a somewhat careless transference of ideas
              that this extension was brought about. Now indeed it is the commoner meaning. We speak
              of the <q>" history of England "</q> without reference to any literary narrative. We
              term kings and statesmen the <q>" makers of history,"</q> and sometimes say that the
              historian only records the history which they make. History in this connexion is
              obviously not the record, but the thing to be recorded. It is unfortunate that such a
              double meaning of the word should have grown up, for it is productive of not a little
              confusion of thought.</p>
                        <p>History in the wider sense is all that has happened, not merely all the phenomena of
              human life, but those of the natural world as well. It includes everything that
              undergoes change ; and as modern science has shown that there is nothing absolutely
              static therefore the whole universe, and every part of it, has its history. The
              discovery of ether brought with it a reconstruction of our ideas of the physical
              universe, transferring the emphasis from the mathematical expression of static
              relationships to a dynamic conception of a universe in constant transformation ;
              matter in equipoise became energy in gradual readjustment. Solids are solids no
              longer. The universe is in motion in every particle of every part; rock and metal
              merely a transition stage between crystallization and dissolution. This idea of
              universal activity has in a sense made physics itself a branch of history. It is the
              same with the other sciences—especially the biological division, where the doctrine of
              evolution has induced an attitude of mind which is distinctly historical.</p>
                        <p>But the tendency to look at things historically is not merely the attitude of men of
              science. Our outlook upon life differs in just this particular from that of preceding
              ages. We recognize the unstable nature of our whole social fabric, and are therefore
              more and more capable of transforming it. Our institutions are no longer held to be
              inevitable and immutable creations. We do not attempt to fit them to absolute
              formulae, but continually adapt them to a changing environment. Even modern
              architecture, notably in America, reflects the consciousness of change. The permanent
              character of ancient or medieval buildings was fitted only to a society dominated by
              static ideals. Now the architect builds, not for all time, but for a set of conditions
              which will inevitably cease in the not distant future. Thus our whole society not only
              bears the marks of its evolution, but shows its growing consciousness of the fact in
              the most evident of its arts. In literature, philosophy and political science, there
              is the same historical trend. Criticism no longer judges by absolute standards ; it
              applies the standards of the author's own environment. We no longer condemn <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare">Shakespeare</name> for having violated the ancient dramatic laws, nor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voltaire">Voltaire</name> for having
              objected to the violations. Each age has its own expression, and in judging each we
              enter the field of history. In ethics, again, the revolt against absolute standards
              limits us to the relative, and morals are investigated on the basis of history, as
              largely conditioned by economic environment and the growth of intellectual freedom.
              Revelation no longer appeals to scientific minds as a source of knowledge. Experience
              on the other hand is history. As for political science, we do not regard the national
              state as that ultimate and final product which men once saw in the Roman empire. It
              has hardly come into being before forces are evident which aim at its destruction.
              Internationalism has gained ground in Europe in recent years ; and Socialism itself,
              which is based upon a distinct interpretation of history, is regarded by its followers
              as merely a stage in human progress, like those which have gone before it. It is
              evident that <ref>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Augustus_Freeman">Freeman</name>'s definition of history as <quote>" past politics "</quote>
                            </ref> is miserably inadequate. Political events are mere externals. History enters
              into every phase of activity, and the economic forces which urge society along are as
              much its subject as the political result.</p>
                        <p>In short the historical spirit of the age has invaded every field. The world-picture
              presented in this encyclopaedia is that of a dynamic universe, of phenomena in process
              of ceaseless change. Owing to this insistent change all things which happen, or seem
              to happen, are history in the broader sense of the word. The encyclopaedia itself is a
              history of them in the stricter sense,— the description and record of this universal
              process. This narrower meaning is the subject of the rest of this article.</p>
                        <p>The word <q>" history "</q> comes from the Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">ίστορία</hi>
                            </foreign>, which was used by the Ionians in the 6th century B.C. for the search for
              knowledge in the widest sense. It meant inquiry, investigation, not narrative. It was
              not until two centuries later that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">historikos</hi>
                            </foreign>, the reciter of stories, superseded the <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">historeōn</hi>
                            </foreign>
                            <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">(ίστορέων)</hi>
                            </foreign>, the seeker after knowledge. Thus history began as a branch of scientific
              research,—much the same as what the Athenians later termed philosophy. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> himself
              was as much a scientific explorer as a reciter of narrative, and his life-long
              investigation was <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">historiē</hi>
                            </foreign> in his Ionian speech. Yet it was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> himself who first
              hinted at the new use of the word, applied merely to the details accumulated during a
              long search for knowledge. It is not until <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, however, that we have
              it definitely applied to the literary product instead of the inquiry which precedes
              it. From <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> to modern times, history (Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">historia</hi>
                            </foreign>) has been a form of literature. It is only in the scientific environment of
              to-day that we recognize once more, with those earliest of the forerunners of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>, that
              history involves two distinct operations, one of which, investigation, is in the field
              of science, while the other, the literary presentation, is in the field of art.</p>
                        <p>The history of history itself is therefore two-fold. History as art flourishes with
              the arts. It calls upon the imagination and the literary gifts of expression. Its
              history does not run parallel with the scientific side, but rather varies in inverse
              ratio with scientific activity. Those periods which have been dominated by the great
              masters of style have been less interested in the criticism of the historian's methods
              of investigation than in the beauty of his rhetoric. The scientific historian, deeply
              interested <pb n="528" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.13.0528.png"/> in the search
              for truth, is generally but a poor artist, and his uncoloured picture of the past will
              never rank in literature beside the splendid distortions which glow in the pages of a
                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Michelet">Michelet</name>
              or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay,_1st_Baron_Macaulay">Macaulay</name>. History the art, in so far as it is conditioned upon genius, has
              no single traceable line of development. Here the product of the age of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles">Pericles</name> remains
              unsurpassed still; the works of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides">Thucydides</name> standing along with
              those of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phidias">Pheidias</name>
              as models for all time. On the other hand, history the science has developed so that
              it has not only gained recognition among historians as a distinct subject, but it has
              raised with it a group of auxiliary sciences which serve either as tools for
              investigation or as a basis for testing the results. The advance in this branch of
              history in the 19th century was one of its greatest achievements. The vast gulf which
              lies between the history of Egypt by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> and that by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flinders_Petrie">Flinders
                Petrie</name> is the measure of its achievement. By the mechanism now at his
              disposal the scientific explorer can read more history from the dust-heaps of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abydos,_Egypt">Abydos</name> than the
              greatest traveller of antiquity could gather from the priests of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sais,_Egypt">Saïs</name>. In tracing the history of
              history we must therefore keep in mind its double aspect.</p>
                        <p>History itself, this double subject, the science and the art combined, begins with
              the dawn of memory and the invention of speech. It is wrong to term those ages <hi rend="italic">pre-historic</hi> whose history has not come down to us, including in
              one category the pre-literary age and the literary whose traces have been lost. Even
              the pre-literary had its history, first in myth and then in saga. The saga, or epos,
              was a great advance upon the myth, for in it the deeds of men replace or tend to
              replace the deeds of the gods. But we are still largely in the realm of imagination.
              Poetry, as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides">Thucydides</name> complained, is a most imperfect medium for fact. The bard will
              exaggerate or distort his story. True history, as a record of what really has
              happened, first reached maturity in prose. Therefore, although much of the past has
              been handed down to us in epic, in ballad and in the legends of folk-lore, we must
              turn from them to what became history in the narrower sense.</p>
                        <p>The earliest prose origins of history are the inscriptions. Their inadequacy is
              evident from two standpoints. Their permanence depends not upon their importance, but
              upon the durability of the substance on which they are inscribed. A note for a wedding
              ring baked into the clay of Babylon has been preserved, while the history of the
              greatest events has perished. In the second place they are sealed to all but those who
              know how to read them, and so they lie forgotten for centuries while oral tradition
              flourishes,—being within the reach of every man. It is only recently that archaeology,
              turning from the field of art, has undertaken to interpret for us this first written
              history. The process by which the modern fits together all the obtainable remains of
              an antiquity, and reconstructs even that past which left no written record, lies
              outside the field of this article. But such enlargement of the field of history is a
              modern scientific product, and is to be distinguished from the imperfect beginnings of
              history-writing which the archaeologist is able to decipher.</p>
                        <p>Next to the inscriptions,—sometimes identical with them,— are the early chronicles.
              These are of various kinds. Family chronicles preserved the memory of heroic ancestors
              whose deeds in the earliest age would have passed into the keeping of the bards. Such
              family archives were perhaps the main source for Roman historians. But they are not
              confined to Rome or Greece. Genealogies also pass from the bald verse, which was the
              vehicle for oral transmission, to such elaborate tables as those in which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manetho">Manetho</name> has preserved
              the dynasties of Egyptian Pharaohs.</p>
                        <p>In this field the priest succeeds the poet. The temple itself became the chief
              repository of records. There were simple religious annals, votive tablets recording
              miracles accomplished at a shrine, lists of priests and priestesses, accounts of
              benefactions, of prodigies and portents. In some cases, as in Rome, the pontiffs kept
              a kind of register, not merely of religious history, but of important political events
              as well. Down to the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gracchi">the Gracchi</name> (131 B.C.) the Pontifex
              Maximus inscribed the year's events upon annual tablets of wood which were preserved
              in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regia">the Regia</name>, the
              official residence of the pontiff in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Forum">the Forum</name>. These pontifical <q>"
                annals "</q> thus came to be a sort of civic history. Chronicles of the Greek cities
              were commonly ascribed to mythical authors, as for instance that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus">Miletus</name>, the oldest, to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cadmus">Cadmus</name> the inventor of
              letters. But they were continued and edited by men in whom the critical spirit was
              awakening, as when the chroniclers of Ionian towns began the criticism of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer">Homer</name>.</p>
                        <p>The first historians were the logographi of these Ionian cities ; men who carried

              to historical criticism and scientific investigation. Whatever the actual achievement
              of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus">Hecataeus</name> may have been, from his time onward the scientific movement was
              set going. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodorus">Herodorus
                of Heraclea</name> struggled to rationalize mythology, and established chronology on
              a solid basis. And finally <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>, a professional
              story-teller, rose to the height of genuine scientific investigation. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>' inquiry
              was not simply that of an idle tourist. He was a critical observer, who tested his
              evidence. It is easy for the student now to show the inadequacy of his sources, and
              his failure here or there to discriminate between fact and fable. But given the
              imperfect medium for investigation and the absence of an archaeological basis for
              criticism, the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> remains a scientific achievement, as remarkable for its
              approximation to truth as for the vastness of its scope. Yet it was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>' chief
              glory to have joined to this scientific spirit an artistic sense which enabled him to
              cast the material into the truest literary form. He gathered all his knowledge of the
              ancient world, not simply for itself, but to mass it around the story of the war
              between the east and west, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people">the Persians</name>. He is first
              and foremost a story-teller ; his theme is like that of the bards, a heroic event. His
              story is a vast prose epos, in which science is to this extent subordinated to art.

              rhetoricians. It is often only clear in the light of inscriptions, so closely does it
              keep to the sources. The style found no imitator; history passed from Greece to Rome
              in the guise of rhetoric. In <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus">Dionysius of
                Halicarnassus</name> the rhetoric was combined with an extensive study of the

              from the standpoint of science. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, although he said that the

              example in education. It is not the subject of a scientific curiosity. It should be
              noted before we pass to Rome that with the expansion of Hellenism the subject of
              historians expanded as well. Universal history was begun by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephorus">Ephorus</name>, the rhetorician, and
              formed the theme of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polybius">Polybius</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diodorus_Siculus">Deodorus</name>. Exiled Greeks
              were the first to write histories of Rome worthy of the name. The Alexandrian <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</name>
              placed chronology upon the scientific basis of astronomy, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollodorus">Apollodorus</name> drew up the most
              important chronica of antiquity.</p>
                        <p>History-writing in Rome,—except for the Greek writers resident there,—was until the
              first half of the 1st century B.C. in the form of annals. Then came rhetorical
              ornamentation,—and the Ciceronian era. The first Roman historian who rose to the
              conception of a science and art combined was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sallust">Sallust</name>, the student of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides">Thucydides</name>. The

              in spite of his searching study of authorities, his keen judgment of men, and his
              perception of underlying principles of moral law, his view was warped by the heat of
              faction, which glows beneath his external objectivity. After him Roman history-writing

                        <p>The 4th and 5th centuries saw a great revolution in the history of history. The story
              of the pagan past slipped out of mind, and in its place was set, by the genius of
                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius_of_Caesarea">Eusebius</name>, the story of the world force which had superseded it,
              Christianity, and of that small fraction of antiquity from which it sprang,— the Jews.
              Christianity from the first had forced thinking men to reconstruct their philosophy of
              history, but it was only after the Church's triumph that its point of view became
              dominant in historiography. Three centuries more passed before the pagan models were
              quite lost to sight. But from the 7th century to the 17th—from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isidore_of_Seville">Isidore of Seville</name> and
              the English <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bede">Bede</name> for
              a thousand years,—mankind was to look back along the line of Jewish priests and kings

The process

              inevitable result of a religion whose sacred books make them lay figures for the
              history of the Jews. Rejected by the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yahweh">Yahweh</name> who became the Christian God,
              they have remained to the present day, in Sunday schools and in common opinion, not
              nations of living men, with the culture of arts and sciences, but outcasts who do not
              enter into the divine scheme of the world's history. When a line was drawn between
              pagan and Christian back to the creation of the world, it left outside the pale of
              inquiry nearly all antiquity. But it must be remembered that that antiquity was one in
              which the German nations had no personal interest. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scipio_(cognomen)">Scipio</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gracchi">the Gracchi</name> were
              essentially unreal to them. The one living organization with which they came into

                        <p>From the first, Christianity had a philosophy of history. Its earliest apologists

              From this central fact of all history, mankind should continue through war and
              suffering until the divine plan was completed at the judgment day. The fate of nations
              is in God's hands; history is the revelation of His wisdom and power. Whether He
              intervenes directly by miracle, or merely sets His laws in operation, He is master of
              men's fate. This idea, which has underlain all Christian philosophy of history, from
              the first apologists who prophesied the fall of the Empire and the coming of the
              millennium, down to our own day, received its classic statement in <bibl>

                        <p>The commonest form of medieval historical writing was the chronicle, which reaches
              all the way from monastic annals, mere notes on Easter tables, to the dignity of
              national monuments. Utterly lacking in perspective, and dominated by the idea of the
              miraculous, they are for the most part a record of the trivial or the marvellous.
              Individual historians sometimes recount the story of their own times with sober
              judgment, but seldom know how to test their sources when dealing with the past.
              Contradictions are often copied down without the writer noticing them ; and since
                <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
                ages</name> forged and falsified so many documents,— monasteries, towns and
              corporations gaining privileges or titles of possession by the bold use of them,—the
              narrative of medieval writers cannot be relied upon unless we can verify it by
              collateral evidence. Some historians, like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_of_Freising">Otto of Freising</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guibert_of_Nogent">Guibert of
                Nogent</name> or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernard_Gui">Bernard Gui</name>, would have been scientific if they had had our appliances for
              comparison. But even men like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Bacon">Roger Bacon</name>, who deplored the
              inaccuracy of texts, had worked out no general method to apply in their restoration.
              Toward the close of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> the vernacular literatures were adorned with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Filippo_Villani">Villani</name>'s and
                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Froissart">Froissart</name>'s chronicles. But the merit of both lies in their journalistic
              qualities of contemporary narrative. Neither was a history in the truest sense.</p>

                Renaissance</name> marked the first great gain in the historic sense, in the efforts
              of the humanists to realize the spirit of the antique world. They did not altogether
              succeed; antiquity to them meant largely <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>. Their interests were
              literary, and the un-Ciceronian centuries were generally ignored. Those in which the
              foundations of modern Europe were laid, which produced parliaments, cathedrals,
              cities, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dante_Alighieri">Dante</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geoffrey_Chaucer">Chaucer</name>, were grouped
              alike on one dismal level and christened <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. The
              perspective of the humanists was only one degree better than that of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>.
              History became the servant to literature, an adjunct to the classics. Thus it passed
              into the schools, where text-books still in use devote 200 pages to the Peloponnesian
              war and two to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">the
                Athens</name> of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles">Pericles</name>.</p>
                        <p>But if the literary side of humanism has been a barrier to the progress of scientific
              history, the discovery and elucidation of texts first made that progress possible.
              Historical criticism soon awoke. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorenzo_Valla">Laurentius Valla</name>'s brilliant

                        <p>In the 19th century the science of history underwent a sort of industrial revolution.

              set going in all the archives of Europe. Isolated workers or groups of workers grew
              into national or international associations, producing from archives vast collections
              of material to be worked up into the artistic form of history. The result of this

              of material, and then to the gigantic task of indexing what they have produced—have
              made it possible for the student in an American or Australian college to master in a
              few hours in his library sources of history which baffled the long years of research
              of a <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmond_Martène">Martène</name> or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Rymer">Rymer</name>. The texts themselves
              have mostly become as correct as they can ever be, and manuals and bibliographies
              guide one to and through them, so that no one need go astray who takes the trouble to
              make use of the mechanism which is at his hand. For example, since the papal archives
              were opened, so many <foreign xml:lang="la">

              the medieval popes day by day for century after century.</p>
                        <p>The apparatus for this research is too vast to be described here. Archives have been
              reformed, their contents catalogued or calendared ; government commissions have
              rescued numberless documents from oblivion or destruction, and learned societies have
              supplemented and criticized this work and co-ordinated the results. Every state in
              Europe now has published the main sources for its history. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rolls_Series">The <q>" Rolls "</q> series</title>,

                        <p>Every science which deals with human phenomena is in a way an implement in this great
              factory system, in which the past is welded together again. Psychology has been drawn
              upon to interpret the movements of revolutions or religions, anthropology and
              ethnology furnish a clue to problems to which the key of documents has been lost.
              Genealogy, heraldry and chronology run parallel with the wider subject. But the real
              auxiliary sciences to history are those which deal with those traces of the past that
              still exist, the science of language (philology), of writing (palaeography), of
              documents (diplomatic), of seals (sphragistics), of coins (numismatics), of weights
              and measures, and archaeology in the widest sense of the word. These sciences underlie
              the whole development of scientific history. Dictionaries and manuals are the
              instruments of this industrial revolution. Without them the literary remains of the
              race would still be as useless as Egyptian inscriptions to the fellaheen. Archaeology
              itself remained but a minor branch of art until the machinery was perfected which
              enabled it to classify and interpret the remains of the <q>" pre-historic "</q>
              age.</p>
                        <p>This is the most remarkable chapter in the whole history of history—the recovery of
              that past which had already been lost when our literary history began. The perspective
              stretches out as far the other side of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer">Homer</name> as we are this. The old <q>"
                providential "</q> scheme of history disintegrates before a new interest in the <q>"
                gentile "</q> nations to whose high culture Hebrew sources bore unwilling testimony.
              Biblical criticism is a part of the historic process. The Jewish texts, once the
              infallible basis of history, are now tested by the libraries of Babylon, from which
              they were partly drawn, and Hebrew history sinks into its proper place in the wide
              horizon of antiquity. The finding of the Rosetta stone left us no longer dependent
              upon Greek, Latin or Hebrew sources, and now fifty centuries of Egyptian history lie
              before us. The scientific historian of antiquity works on the hills of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">Crete</name>, rather than in
              the quiet of a library with the classics spread out before him. There he can
              reconstruct the splendour of that <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minoan_civilization">Minoan age</name> to which
              Homeric poems look back, as the Germanic epics looked back to Rome or Verona. His
              discoveries, co-ordinated and arranged in vast <foreign xml:lang="la">

              revealed how men were living while the monks wrote chronicles, and now cathedrals and

              checked by contemporary evidence, and a clearer sense of what constitutes a primary
              source has discredited much of what had been currently accepted as true. This is true
              not only of ancient history, where last year's book may be a thousand years out of
              date, but of the whole field. Hardly an <q>"old master"</q> remains an authoritative
              book of reference. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Gibbon">Gibbon</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Grote">Grote</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Giesebrecht">Giesebrecht</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Guizot">Guizot</name> stand
              to-day by reason of other virtues than their truth. Old landmarks drop out of
              sight—e.g. the fall of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Roman_Empire">the Western Empire</name> in
              476, the coming of the Greeks to Italy in 1450, dates which once enclosed <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>.

              Revolution becomes a complex of economics and politics and religion; the French
              Revolution a vast social reform in which the Terror was an incident, etc., etc. The
              result has been a complete transformation of history since the middle of the 19th

              constructive principle in history which could take the place of the Providence they
              rejected. Religion, though false, might be a real historic force. History became the
              tragic spectacle of a game of dupes—the real movers being priests, kings or warriors.
              The pawns slowly acquired reason, and then would be able to regulate the moves
              themselves. But all this failed to give a satisfactory explanation of the laws which
              determine the direction of this evolution. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giambattista_Vico">Giovanni Battista Vico</name>
              (1668-1744) was the first to ask why there is no science of human history. But his
              lonely life and unrecognized labours leave him apart from the main movement, until his
              works were discovered again in the 19th century. It was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arnold_Hermann_Ludwig_Heeren">A.L.H. Heeren</name>
              who, at the opening of the 19th century, first laid that emphasis upon the economic
              factors in history which is to-day slowly replacing the Augustinian explanation of its
              evolution. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arnold_Hermann_Ludwig_Heeren">Heeren</name>'s own
              influence, however, was slight. The first half of the century (apart from the
              scientific activity of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Heinrich_Pertz">Pertz</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Guizot">Guizot</name>, etc.)
              was largely dominated by the romanticists, with their exaggeration of the individual. <ref>

                            </ref> is logically connected with the age of Scott. It was a philosophy of history
              which lent itself to magnificent dramatic creations ; but it explained nothing. It
              substituted the work of the genius for the miraculous intervention of Providence, but,
              apart from certain abstract formulae such as Truth and Right, knew nothing of why or
              how. It is but dealing in words to say that the meaning of it all is God's revelation
              of Himself. Granting that, what is the process ? Why does it so slowly reveal the
              Right of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
                ages</name> (as in slavery for instance) to be the Wrong to-day ? <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Carlyle">Carlyle</name> stands
              to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacques-Bénigne_Bossuet">Bossuet</name> as the sage to the myth. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel">Hegel</name> got no
              closer to realities. His idealistic scheme of history, which makes religion the
              keynote of progress, and describes the function of each—Judaism to typify duty,
              Confucianism order, Mahommedanism justice, Buddhism patience, and Christianity
              love—does not account for the facts of the history enacted by the devotees. It
              characterizes, not the real process of evolution, but an ideal which history has not
              realized. Besides, it does not face the question how far religion itself is a product
              or a cause, or both combined.</p>

              ignored in his spiritism—recognizing that life is conditioned by an environment and

                dominate all history. He distinctly stated that <quote>" the advance of European

              formulation of his laws, his pioneer work in a great field marks him out as the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_of_Hippo">Augustine</name>
              of the scientific age. Among historians, however, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Thomas_Buckle">Buckle</name>'s theory
              received but little favour for another generation. Meanwhile the economists had

              which constitutes the history of society are to be found in the economic conditions of
              existence. From this he went on to socialism, which bases its militant philosophy upon

              controversy has been almost as heated as in the days of the Reformation. It is an
              exaggeration of the theory which makes it an explanation of all human life, but the
              whole science of dynamic sociology rests upon the postulate of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">Marx</name>.</p>
                        <p>The content of history always reflects the interests of the age in which it is
              written. It was so in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> and in medieval chronicles. Modern historians began with politics.
              But as the complex nature of society became more evident in the age of democracy, the
              economic or sociological history gained ground. Histories of commerce and cities now
              rank beside those on war and kings, although there are readers still who prefer to
              follow the pennants of robber barons rather than to watch the slow evolution of modern
              conditions. The drum-and-trumpet history has its place like that of art,
              jurisprudence, science or philosophy. Only now we know that no one of these is more
              than a single glimpse at a vast complex of phenomena, most of which lie for ever
              beyond our ken.</p>
                        <p>This expansion of interest has intensified specialization. Historians no longer
              attempt to write world histories ; they form associations of specialists for the
              purpose. Each historian chooses his own epoch or century and his own subject, and
              spends his life mastering such traces of it as he can find. His work there enables him
              to judge of the methods of his fellows, but his own remains restricted by the very
              wealth of material which has been accumulated on the single subject before him. Thus
              the great enterprises of to-day are co-operative—the <title>

                        <p>The beginnings of physical science are to be sought in the slow and unconscious
              observation by primitive races of men of natural occurrences, such as the apparent
              movements of the heavenly bodies, and in the gradually acquired mastery over the rude
              implements by the aid of which such men strove to increase the security and comfort of
              their lives. Biological science similarly must have begun with observation of the
              plants and animals useful to man, and with empirical medicine and surgery. It was only
              when a considerable progress had been made with ordered knowledge that men began to
              ask questions about the meaning and causes of the phenomena, and to discern the
              connexions between them.</p>
                        <p>In the earliest stage of development it seems that an anthropomorphic or mythological
              explanation is always assigned to the phenomena of nature. With no clue to trace the
              regularity of sequence and connexion between those phenomena, an untutored mind
              inevitably refers the apparently capricious events which succeed each other to the
              direct and immediate intervention of some unseen being of a nature essentially similar
              to his own. The sun is the flaming chariot of the sun-god, driven day by day across
              the heavens; the clouds are cows from which milk descends as nourishing rain on the
              fruitful earth. We may regard such myths as childlike fancies, but they were doubtless
              an advance on the want of all explanation which preceded them; they supplied
              hypotheses which, besides giving rise to themes of beauty and suggestiveness for
              poetry and art, played the first and chief part of a scientific hypothesis in pointing
              the way for further inquiry. Much useful knowledge was acquired and much skill gained
              in logical analysis before these primitive explanations were proved insufficient. A
              false theory which can be compared with facts may be more useful at a given stage of
              development than a true one beyond the comprehension of the time, and incapable of
              examination by observation or experiment by any means then known. The Newtonian theory
              of gravitation might be useless to a savage, to whose mind the animistic view of
              nature brought conviction and helpful ideas, which he could test by experience.</p>

                        <p>The phenomena of the heavens are at once the most striking, the most easily observed
              and the most regular of those which <pb n="397" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0397.png"/> are impressed inevitably on the minds
              of thinking men. Thus it is to astronomy we must look for the first development of
              scientific ideas. The orientation of many prehistoric monuments shows that a certain
              amount of astronomical observation had been acquired at a very early age, and <name type="people">the Chaldeans</name> seem to have gone so far as to recognize a law of
              periodicity even in eclipses. From the land of Asia the Greeks took their earliest
              ideas of science, and it is to the Ionian philosophers, of whom <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thales">Thales of Miletus</name> (580 B.C.) is
              regarded as the first, that we must turn for the earliest known example of an advance
              on the mythological view of nature. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaximenes_of_Miletus">Anaximenes</name> recognized
              the rotation of the heavens round the pole star, and saw that the dome overhead was
              but the half of a complete sphere. The earth was thus deprived of the base stretching
              to unfathomed depths imagined by the mythologists, and left free to float as a
              flattened cylinder at the centre of the celestial sphere. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaximenes_of_Miletus">Anaximenes</name>, too,
              seems to have grasped the doctrine of the uniformity of nature, teaching that all
              material transformations must have a true cause.</p>
                        <p>Next came <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pythagoras">the
                Pythagoreans</name>, who simplified these conceptions by the suggestion that instead
              of a rotation of the vast sphere of the heavens the earth itself might be a sphere and
              revolve about a central fixed point, like a stone at the end of a string. The
              uninhabited side of the earth always faced the fixed point, and its inhabited side
              faced successively the different parts of the heavens At the central fixed point they
              placed a <q>"universal fire,"</q> which, like the fire on an altar, served as a centre
              for the circling of the worshipping earth. Mythology was losing its hold of science,
              but mystical symbolism still held sway. When, however, in the 4th century B.C. the
              growth of geographical discovery failed to disclose any trace of this central fire,
              the idea of its existence faded away, and was replaced by the conception of the
              revolution of the earth on its own axis. Finally, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristarchus_of_Samos">Aristarchus</name> (280
              B.C.), believing that the sun was larger than the earth, thought it unlikely that it
              should revolve round the earth, and developed a heliocentric theory. But the time was
              not ripe; no indisputable evidence could be adduced, no general conviction followed,
              and to mankind the earth remained the centre of creation till many centuries later.
              Even to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name>, the visible universe consisted of the central earth with its
              attendant water, air and aether founded by the sphere of the heavens, which formed the
              flaming walls of the world—<foreign xml:lang="la">

                        <p>Simultaneously with the birth of astronomy the problem of matter came into being. The
              old Ionian nature philosophers, observing the sequence of changes from earth and water
              into the structure of plants and the bodies of animals, and through them again into
              the original constituents, began to grasp the conception of the indestructibility of
              matter, and to put forward the idea that all forms of matter might ultimately consist
              of a single <q>"element."</q> But the conception of a single ultimate basis of matter
              was far in advance of the age. It is only now becoming a fertile working hypothesis in
              the light of all the gigantic increase in knowledge of the intervening two thousand
              years. At the time when it was put forward, the conception was of little use, and the
              immediate path of advance was found in the idea of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empedocles">Empedocles</name> (450 B.C.) that the
              primary elements were four: earth, water, air and fire— a solid, a liquid, a gas and
              the flame which seemed to the ancients a type of matter of still rarer structure. This
              hypothesis served to interpret the phenomena of nature for many centuries, till, in
              modern days, the growth of chemistry disclosed the seventy or eighty elements of our
              text-books. Signs are not wanting that they too have served their turn as a conception
              of the ultimate nature of matter, while still maintaining their place as the proximate
              units of chemical action.</p>

                        <p>In the four elements of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empedocles">Empedocles</name> we trace the germ of
              the ideas of the Atomists. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empedocles">Empedocles</name> saw that, by
              combining his separate elements in different proportions, he could explain all the
              endless differences in matter as known to the senses. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leucippus">Leucippus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> developed the
              conception and gave to the world the theory of atoms, described at a later date by the
              Roman poet <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name>. As matter is subdivided does it keep its characteristic
              properties throughout? Is iron always iron, however finely we divide it; is water
              always water? Are the properties of any kind of matter ultimate facts of which no
              explanation—no description in simpler terms—is possible? To avoid answering this last
              question in the affirmative, and resigning all hope of an advance in knowledge, the
              atomic theory of the Greeks was framed.</p>
                        <p>To recognize the significance of the doctrines of the Greek Atomists, we must remove
              from our minds all sense of comparison with the atomic theory of to-day. The Greeks
              had none of the detailed physical and chemical knowledge on which that theory is
              founded, and which it was framed to explain. The object of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leucippus">Leucippus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> was quite different
              from that of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Dalton">Dalton</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amedeo_Avogadro">Avogadro</name>. To the latter,
              the conception of atoms and molecules served as a means of explaining certain definite
              and detailed facts of chemical combination and gaseous volume in a more definite and
              exact way than any other hypothesis available at the time. To the Greek philosophers,
              the atomic theory was an attempt to make the universe intelligible. The particular
              explanation offered was not of so much importance as the idea that an explanation of
              some kind was possible. When we see the beliefs that held sway before their day, we
              realize the advance their ideas produced. The qualities of substances were thought to
              be of their essence—the sweetness of sugar was as much a reality as sugar itself, the
              black colour of water must survive all changes in its form, so that, to one who knew
              this doctrine, snow could never look white again. It was such confusion as this—such
              denial of facts if they failed to support a theory—that <ref>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name>
                assailed:— <quote>"According to convention there is a sweet and a bitter, a hot and
                  a cold, and according to convention there is colour. In truth there are atoms and
                  a void."</quote>
                            </ref> Atoms were many in size and shape, but identical in substance. All qualitative
              differences in substances were to be assigned to differences in size, shape, situation
              and movement of particles of the same ultimate nature. No attempt was made to examine
              into the nature of this ultimate substance; but one set of phenomena was expressed in
              terms of something simpler, and no <q>"explanation"</q> even of the most recondite
              observation by the most modern physicist can do more.</p>
                        <p>The atomic theory of the Greeks as transmitted to us by the poem of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name> presented
              a wonderfully consistent picture of nature within the limits of the knowledge of their
              day. It is easy to show where it fails in the light of the knowledge of phenomena we
              now possess; it is easy to point to places where, as in its application to
              psychological problems, its authors passed in imagination over logical chasms without
              even seeing that a difficulty existed. But the attempt to frame an intelligible
              picture was a great step in advance, and a study of the flaws which we can now detect
              may serve to suggest the provisional nature of some of the theories by tbe aid of
              which knowledge is advancing so fast in our own day.</p>
                        <p>But the great difference between the position of the Greeks and that of ourselves in
              regard to natural knowledge consists in the small number of phenomena known to them
              contrasted with the enormous wealth of accumulated observation which is available for
              us, as the result of years of experiment with the aid of apparatus unknown to the
              ancients. When a new theory is put forward, it is now almost always possible to test
              its concordance with facts by the use of material already accumulated, or to suggest,
              in the light of such material, experiments which will serve to refute it, or to lend
              it greater probability. Thus a theory which survives the trials that follow its birth
              has nowadays a fairly long expectation of life—probably the theory will serve to
              interpret phenomena discovered either by its means or in other ways for some time to
              come. But in the ancient world this was not so. To test a new theory, other phenomena
              were very rarely available than those which suggested it, or to explain which it was
              put forward. Thus thought was much more speculative, and, as is still the case with
              metaphysics, no general consensus of opinion was reached. Each philosopher had a
              system of his own in science, just as he still has in metaphysics—a system which,
              beginning from first <pb n="398" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0398.png"/>
              principles anew, raises on them a superstructure, which, even if it logically follows
              from them, can have no more validity than the premises on which it is based. When the
              premises are not accepted by other philosophers, the whole scheme becomes merely the
              doctrine of one man, and, if it lives at all, may oppress by the dead weight of
              authority the struggle of living thought beneath it.</p>

                        <p>The history of the atomic theory of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leucippus">Leucippus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> illustrates the
              difficulties of a position where speculation has outstripped observation. The theory
              was nearer what is now accepted as truth than any other of the ancient schemes of
              physics. Yet the grounds on which it was based were so insecure that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> (c. 340
              B.C), who started with other preconceptions, was able to bring to bear such
              destructive criticism that the theory ceased to occupy the foremost place in Greek
              thought. Although, with the knowledge then available, we can but admit that some of
                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name>
              criticism was just, much of it consists of metaphysical arguments against the
              atomists, while in parts he rejects true conclusions owing to what he considers their
              impossibility. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name>, for instance, had held that all things would fall with equal
              speed in a vacuum, and that the fact that heavy bodies were observed to fall faster
              than very light ones was due to the resistance of the air. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus's</name> belief was true,
              though he was of course quite unconscious of the grounds on which it can alone be
              demonstrated—the universal attraction of gravity, and the remarkable and curious
              experimental fact that the weights of bodies are proportional to their masses. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> agrees
              that in a vacuum all bodies would fall at an equal rate, but the conclusion appears to
              him so inconceivable that he rejects the idea of the existence of any empty space at
              all, and with the <q>"void"</q> rejects the rest of the allied concepts of the atomic
              theory. If all bodies were composed of the same ultimate matter, he argues, they must
              all be heavy, and nothing would be light in itself and disposed to rise. A large mass
              of air or fire would then necessarily be heavier than a small mass of earth or water.
              This result he thinks impossible, for certain bodies always tend upwards and rise
              faster as their bulk increases. It will be seen that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> has no idea of the
              conceptions we now call density and specific gravity, though clear views about the
              question why some things rise through water or air might have been obtained without
              the aid of physical apparatus. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> doctrine that bodies
              are essentially heavy or light in themselves persisted all through the middle ages,
              and did much to delay the attainment of more exact knowledge. It was not till <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo
                Galilei</name> (1564-1642) discovered by actual experiment that, in cases where the
              resistance of the air is negligible, heavy things fall at the same speed as light
              ones, that the Aristotelian dogma was overthrown.</p>

                        <p>Turning to the biological sciences, we may trace a somewhat similar course of
              development. Owing to its practical importancc, medicine has left many records by
              which its progress can be traced. Just as primitive man personified the sun and the
              moon, the wind and the sea, so he regarded disease as due to the action of some
              malignant demon or to the spells of some human enemy. Once more Greek literature
              enables us to trace the gradual decrease in the importance assigned to charms and
              magic, and the growth of more rational ideas among physicians. But here, as in the
              physical sciences, the philosophic range of the intellect of the Greeks led them
              astray. Assumptions as to the nature of man or the origin of organic life were too
              often made the starting point of a train of deductive reasoning, the consequences of
              which were not always compared with the results of observation and experiment, even
              where such comparison was possible. The Greek philosophers tried to make bricks
              without straw, usually in sublime unconsciousness that straw was necessary. Many
              centuries of humble observation and tentative fitting together of small parts of the
              great puzzle were needed before enough material was collected to make possible useful
              generalizations about the questions, answers to which the Greeks assumed as the very
              basis of their inquiries.</p>
                        <p>Among the multitude of their guesses, a few somewhat resembled the views that are now
              again rising into prominence from the basis of definite and exact experiment. A good
              example of the strength and weakness of ancient speculation is found in the cosmogony
              of the atomists, both on its physical and on its biological side. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name> describes how the world
              was formed by the conjunction of streams of atoms, which condensed into the earth,
              with its attendant water, air and aether, to form a self-contained whole. Unconscious
              of the mighty gap between inorganic matter and living beings, he proceeds to tell how,
              in the chances of infinite time, all possible forms of life appeared, while only those
              fittest to survive persisted and reared offspring. Here, surrounded by unsupported
              statements and false conclusions, we see dimly the germs of the ideas of the nebular
              hypothesis and the theory of natural selection, though <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name> had the profoundest
              ignorance of the difficulties of the problem, and the vast stretches of time necessary
              for cosmical and biological development.</p>
                        <p>In those branches of biological science in which less ambitious theorizing and more
              detailed observation were forced on the Greeks, considerable progress was made. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> compiled
              a laborious account of the animals known in his day, with many accurate details of
              their anatomical structure. Beginning from an earlier date, steady advance was made
              with geographical discovery. Maps of the known world, developed from the local maps
              invented by the Egyptians for the purposes of landsurveying, gave definiteness to the
              knowledge thus acquired and showed its bearing on wider problems.</p>

                        <p>One of the most striking successes of Greek thought is seen in the development of
              geometry. Geometry has a twofold importance, as being itself the study of the
              properties of the space known to our senses, and as teaching us methods and means of
              studying nature by unfolding the full logical consequences of any hypothesis: geometry
              is the best type of deductive reasoning. Based on axioms, the result of simple
              experience, it traces from the ideas of solids, surfaces, lines and points the
              properties of other figures defined in terms of those ideas. As an example to other
              sciences, the deductive geometry of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euclid">Euclid</name> (c. 300 B.C.) had, perhaps,
              an unfortunate influence in emphasizing the deductive method, and teaching men to
              neglect the need of verifying by experiment the theories put forward to explain the
              more complex phenomena of nature at the conclusion, and at each possible step, of the
              deduction. But, in itself, the science of Euclidian geometry was brought to such a
              state of perfection that no advance was made till modern times: no change even in form
              attempted till quite recently. Unlike some other branches of inquiry we have
              mentioned, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euclid">Euclid's</name> geometry carried universal conviction, and represented a permanent
              step in advance which never had to be retraced.</p>

                        <p>Alongside the study of individual sciences, the Greeks paid even more attention to
              the laws of thought, and to the examination of the essence of the methods by which
              knowledge in general is acquired. In opposition to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato's</name> theory that all knowledge is
              but the unfolding and development of forgotten memories of a previous state of
              existence, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> taught that we learn to reach the generalizations, which alone the
              Greeks regarded as knowledge, by remembering, comparing and co-ordinating numerous
              particular acts or judgments of sense, which are thus used as a means of gaining
              knowledge by the action of the innate and infallible nous or intellect. Neither <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> nor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> could be
              satisfied without finding infallibility somewhere. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, it is true,
              investigated the logical processes by which we pass from particular instances to
              general propositions, and laid stress on the importance of observing the facts before
              generalizing about them, but he had little appreciation of the conditions in which
              observation and the induction based on it must be conducted in practice in order to
              obtain results where the probability of error is a minimum. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> regarded induction
              merely as a necessary preliminary to true science of the deductive type best seen in
              geometry, and, in applying his principles, he never reached the <q>"positive"</q>
              stage, in which metaphysical problems are evaded, if not excluded, <pb n="399" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0399.png"/> and a scheme of natural knowledge
              built up in a consistent manner, so that metaphysical ideas, though they may underlie
              the foundation of the ultimate conceptions, do not intrude between the parts of the
              building. Hence <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> explanations often turn directly on metaphysical ideas such as
              form, cause, substance, terms which do not occur (in the Aristotelian sense) in modern

                        <p>A century later than the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes of Syracuse</name> (287 to
              212 B.C.) formulated the fundamental conceptions of hydrostatics and took what may be
              regarded origin of as the first step in the science of mechanics. The use of the lever
              must have been discovered at a very early date, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes</name> set to work to
              investigate its quantitative laws by the application of principles learnt from the
              geometers. He begins by laying down two axioms : (1) Equal weights placed at equal
              distances from the point of support of a bar will balance: (2) Equal weights placed at
              unequal distances do not balance, but that which hangs at the greater distance
              descends. The ancient philosophers based such axioms as the first of these two on the
                <q>"principle of sufficient reason."</q> No motion can take place, because, from the
              symmetry of the system, there is no reason why the balance should descend on one side
              more than the other. Even if we grant the theoretical validity of this principle, it
              is impossible to make sure without trial that the system in any given case is really
              symmetrical. Electrification of the bar, for instance, though imperceptible to our
              senses, would cause one end to descend if an oppositely electrified body were placed
              near that end; we cannot assume without trial that the position of the sun, or the
              colour of the arms, will not affect the result. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes</name> based the second
              axiom on the sounder ground of direct experience. On these two axioms he proceeded to
              construct an elaborate deductive proof of the numerical law of the lever, but, in the
              course of it, he assumed as known the principle of the centre of gravity. In reality,
              this principle is identical with that of the lever, and assuming one, implicitly we
              assume the other. Nevertheless, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes'</name> proof is of use and
              interest. On the assumptions made, it shows the connexion between the general case of
              the lever with unequal arms, and the special and more familiar case when the arms are
              equal. Indeed, if we also treat the principle of the centre of gravity as an axiom
              known by experience, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes'</name> proof is a true type of all scientific <q>"explanations"</q>; it
              reduces an unfamiliar phenomenon to others already well known to our minds, which,
              creatures of habit as they are, regard the familiar cases as in no need of
              explanation. Nowadays we should treat the law of the lever of unequal arms as one that
              is verified by direct and familiar experiment, and use it, in its turn, as the
              starting point for further deduction.</p>

              barbarian conquests, the seeds were sown which germinating after the lapse of
              centuries, developed in the more fruitful soil of the age of experiment. But for a
              time they were buried, and only remembered by compendiums written just before the
              ancient light was wholly lost. During the dark ages, the contents of secular learning,
              based on those compendiums, settled down into the elementary <q>"trivium,"</q>
              consisting of grammar, rhetoric and dialectic, and the more advanced
                <q>"quadrivium"</q> music, arithmetic, geometry and astronomy. Music included a

              while arithmetic and astronomy were cultivated chiefly because they taught the means

              experiments on the transformations of various substances. It was probably from them

              recovery of some of the lost works of the ancient writers, we turn a new page. The
              controversy between <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> upon the doctrine of ideas fascinated the minds of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>,
              saturated as they were with the logical subtleties of dialectic. This controversy
              originated the long debate on the reality of universals, which absorbed the
              intellectual energies of many generations of men. Did reality belong only to the idea
              or universal—to the class rather than to the individual—to the common humanity of
              mankind, for instance, rather than to each isolated being? Or were the individuals the
              reality, and the universals mere names? In this question, trivial, almost meaningless,
              as it seems at first sight, logical analysis disclosed to the medieval mind the whole
              theory of the universe. Either answer contained danger to theological orthodoxy as
              then understood; hence the fervour with which it was debated. But, as communication
              with the East was reopened early in the 13th century, Latin translations of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> works
              gradually were recovered; the whole of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> philosophy was
              reimported into the schools of Europe, and reconciled and adopted by Christian
              theology. For three hundred years <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> reigned supreme in
              European thought, and exponents of the scholastic philosophy, ignoring their master's
              teaching on the need of experiment, settled questions of fact as well as those of
              opinion by an appeal to his books. But outside the academic schools of the newly
              founded universities, experiment was kept alive by the labours of the alchemists, who,
              early in the 13th century, caught their ideas from the Arabs, and began to search for
              an <foreign xml:lang="la">

                            </foreign> and for a means of transmuting baser metals into gold. But alchemy never
              quite squared its account with orthodox theology, and the <q>"sacred science"</q> of
              the Alexandrians became associated in the medieval mind with the <q>"black art"</q> of
              witchcraft. Even a man like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Bacon">Roger Bacon</name>, who, with some
              astrological mysticism, had a more modern idea of experiment both in chemical and

              was not, as it is sometimes represented, a sudden break with medievalism and a birth
              of the modern world. But a number of conditions favourable to rapid development
              happened to coincide, and, in the course of a century, men's outlook on themselves and
              on nature became profoundly modified. The recovery of the Greek language, the voyages
              of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christopher_Columbus">Columbus</name>, the decay of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Roman_Empire">the Western</name>

              view of the universe which had been current among the Greeks, in place of the mystical
              aspect which it wore to the medieval schoolmen and ecclesiastics. At first the
              tendency was to substitute the authority of the ancients for the authority of the
              schoolmen, but gradually more independence of thought was secured; men like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da

              anatomy began again to be studied in the schools of medicine, gradually making its way

                        <p>The philosophy of the new experimental methods was first studied deeply by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Francis Bacon</name>
              (1561-1626). Sensible of the confused and disjointed information which then
              constituted the only scientific knowledge, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> set himself to describe
              a new method by which definite knowledge might be acquired with certainty. Warned by
              the failure of the scholastic methods, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> laid exclusive stress
              on experimental research, and it was perhaps natural that he should incline to the
              other extreme and ignore almost entirely the use of hypothesis and the deductive
              method. To arrive at the underlying causes, said <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name>, we must study the <pb n="400" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0400.png"/> natural history of the
              phenomena, collect and tabulate all obseravtions which bear on them, notice which
              phenomena are related in such a way as to vary together, and then, by a merely
              mechanical process of exclusion, we discover the cause of any given phenomenon. As a
              corrective of the medieval philosophy <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon's</name> work was of the
              greatest value in the history of thought, and, from this point of view, it is perhaps
              but a small drawback that scientific discovery is seldom or never made by the pure
              Baconian method. The multitude of phenomena are too great for any subject to be
              attacked with success without the aid of hypothesis framed by the use of the
              scientific imagination. Facts are collected to prove or disprove the consequences
              deduced from the hypothesis, and thus the number of facts to be examined becomes
              manageable.</p>

                        <p>Even while <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> was philosophizing, the true method was being used by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo
                Galilei</name> (1564-1642) to found the science of dynamics. We have seen how the
              Aristotelians held the belief that every body sought its natural place, the place of
              heavy bodies being below and that of light ones above. Innate qualities of heaviness
              and lightness were thus invoked to explain why some things fell, and others, in
              similar circumstances, rose. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</name>, rightly rejecting
              the whole current point of view, set himself to examine not why, but how, things fell.
              This change of attitude was in itself one of his great achievements. Now a falling
              body starts from rest and falls with a speed which is increasing constantly. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</name>
              sought to find the law of increase. To isolate the real law out of all possible laws
              he made a guess at a simple law which seemed likely to be true. He assumed that the
              speed acquired is proportional to the distance fallen through. But, working out the
              consequences of this hypothesis, he soon convinced himself that it involved a
              contradiction. He abandoned the hypothesis and made another. He supposed that the
              speed was proportional to the time of fall. Again he deduced mathematically the
              consequences of this new hypothesis, and, finding no inconsistencies, put some of his
              deductions to the test of experiment, and verified their accuracy. Thus <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</name>
              proved mathematically that, if the speed of fall is proportional to the time from the
              moment of starting, the space traversed by a falling body must be proportional to the
              square of the time of fall. To verify this result experimentally, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</name> convinced himself
              that a body falling down an inclined plane acquired a speed which is the same as that
              it would have attained in falling through the same vertical height. He was able
              therefore to use a slow fall down a plane for his experiments instead of the
              unmanageably rapid course of a body falling freely. Nor was this all. From this stage
              of the investigation another consequence of his results was found to spring. A ball
              after running down an inclined plane of a certain height will run up another plane of
              the same height irrespective of its inclination—that is, if friction be small. The
              second plane may be made very long, but still, if its final height be the same, the
              ball will reach its end. Hence it is the height that matters; none of the speed of the
              ball is destroyed unless it rises. If the second plane be made horizontal, the ball
              will thus run on for ever unless stopped by friction or some other applied force. This
              fundamental result, put into definite words by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name>, is known as the first
              law of motion, and is the foundation of the whole science of dynamics. In <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo's</name> day
              it was an entirely new conception. It has been assumed that every motion required some
              cause or force to maintain it. Hence arose the need of hypothetical vortices to
              maintain planetary movements, and similar complications in astronomy and mechanics.
              But it now became evident that it was not the continuous motion of the planets which
              needed explanation, but the constant deflection of that motion from the straight path
              it would hold if no applied force were in action. The way was open for Newton.</p>

                Newton</name> (1642-1727) proved mathematically that the observed motion of the
              planets about the sun could be explained, and explained only, by the supposition that
              the sun exerted a force on each planet proportional inversely to the square of its
              distance from the planet. But the earth, at any rate, does attract bodies on or near
              its surface, the phenomenon being the familiar but mysterious gravity. Is this force
              competent to account for the motion of the moon round the earth? On the assumption of
              the law of inverse squares, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> calculated what the
              known force of gravity would become at the distance of the moon. Owing to faulty data,
              his first result indicated that the force would be too great, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> put aside his
              calculations. Six years later a new determination of the size of the earth gave him a

              in her orbit were due to the same cause. The mechanism by means of which the force is
              exerted remained unrevealed to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name>, and has baffled all
              inquirers since his day, but the discovery that all the movements of the heavens could

              history of science.</p>

                        <p>These speculations, isolated at first, coalesced with the more detailed conclusions
              of geology during the 19th century. The earlier conceptions of the origin of the rocks
              of the earth imagined catastrophes of fire or water, processes alien to those of
              everyday experience. But the <q>"uniformitarian"</q> school, founded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Hutton">James Hutton</name>
              (1726-1797) and expounded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Lyell">Sir Charles Lyell</name>
              (1797-1875), produced evidence to show that much, at any rate, of the structure of the
              surface of the globe was produced by the action of causes and processes still going on
              under our eyes. The deposition of material by the action of seas and rivers and other
              natural agencies, e.g. volcanoes, etc., was seen to need only time enough to produce
              beds of rock like those which make up our mountains. Comparison of the fossil remains
              of plants and animals found in different kinds of rock then enabled geologists to
              classify the rocks, and place them in a chronological sequence. Moreover, it became
              evident that a series of animal and plant types was associated with the gradual
              formation of the rocks, and that the age both of the earth itself and of the organic
              life found on it was much greater than had been suspected. The few thousand years of
              received cosmogonies stretched out into untold millions, during which the same
              familiar laws described the phenomena of development. The remains and traces of man,
              found, it is true, only in the later sedimentary deposits of the earth, still were
              enough to prove his existence through ages beside which the dawn of history was but as
              yesterday. As <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> had extended known principles throughout the gigantic spaces of the
              heavens, so the later geologists pushed them back over enormous epochs of time. The
              extent of the kingdom of ordered knowledge expanded both in space and time to a degree

              for the biological work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin</name> (1809-1882).
              The origin of living beings from a few ancestral types was an old conception, but
              Darwin first found an adequate intelligible cause in the slow action of sexual
              selection, joined to the pressure <pb n="401" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0401.png"/> of the struggle for life, which
              allowed only those individuals most suited by favourable variation to the environment
              to survive and rear their offspring. The advantage thus given to beings with useful
              variations may develop into permanent modifications in the course of ages, and, when
              the parent types have disappeared, their common posterity may exhibit the marked
              differences characteristic of the separate and distinct species now existent. From the
              point of view of scientific thought, the significance of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin's</name> theory lies in the
              new and vast extension it gives to the field in which causes intelligible to the human
              mind can be sought as explanations of phenomena. Thus evolution is co-ordinated in the
              history of thought with the Newtonian theory of gravitation, and with the
              uniformitarian theory of geology.</p>

              devoted their attention to the study of how the useful variations arise. Three views
              have been held. (1) <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck">Jean Baptiste, chevalier de
                Lamarck</name> (1744-1829), regarded variation as due to the accumulated and
              inherited effect of use. Thus the giraffe acquires his long neck by the successive
              efforts of countless generations to browse on leaves just beyond their reach. (2)
                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</name>,
              while accepting changes in accordance with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck">Lamarck's</name> ideas as
              exceptional aids to variation, revolutionized biology by showing the primary
              importance of the struggle for life, when extended over long periods of time, in
              selecting useful variations which arise accidentally or in other ways. (3) <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</name> also
              recognized the possible occasional effect of discontinuous variations or
                <quote>"sports,"</quote> when a plant or an animal diverges from its parents in a
              marked manner. But of late years the study by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugo_de_Vries">Hugo de Vries</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Bateson">William
                Bateson</name> and others, of discontinuous variations which arise spontaneously has
              pointed to the conclusion that in nature such sudden leaps are the normal cause of
              development. If a <q>"sport"</q> has advantages over the parental type, it tends to
              survive, while, if it is not as fitted for its life struggle, it is destroyed by
              natural selection and never establishes itself. Such a theory avoids the difficulty of
              pure <q>"Darwinism,"</q> that organs useful, when fully developed, to an animal or
              plant are of no advantage in incipient stages. Statistical methods, too, suggest that
              a definite limit may exist to the amount of a given variation which proceeds by small
              steps, each insignificant in itself.</p>

              affect the simple germ cells, has led some more recent biologists to pass to the other

                        <p>A new light has been thrown on the problem of inheritance by the recent re-discovery
              of the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gregor_Mendel">G.J. Mendel, abbot of Brunn</name> (1822-1884). Certain characters in both plants
              and animals have been found to be separable, and some of these characters exist in
              pairs, so that the presence of one involves the absence of the other. To take a simple
              example. Blue Andalusian fowls do not breed <q>"true."</q> On the average, half the
              offspring of two blue parents are blue, while the remaining half are divided equally
              between black and white birds. Both black and white when mated with a consort of the
              same colour breed <q>"true"</q> and yield only offspring similar to the parents. A
              white bird mated with a black, however, produces invariably all blue chicks. White
              mated with blue gives half blue and half white, while black mated with blue gives half
              blue and half black. Such phenomena are explained if we suppose that of the germ cells
              of the blue birds half bear the black character and half the white. If, in
              reproduction, a <q>"black"</q> cell meets a <q>"black"</q> the resulting chick is
              black; if <q>"white"</q> meets <q>"white"</q> the chick is white; while if
                <q>"white"</q> meets <q>"black"</q> the chick possesses a mixture of the two
              characters which in this case yield blue colour. But the reproductive cells of this
              intermediate form are not intermediate in character; they possess the pure parental
              characters in equal numbers. Knowing these facts, it is evident that we can reproduce
              any of the results at will, and from the mixed blue type produce a pure true breed of
              either black or white birds. Experiments of this kind must lead to a power of breeding
              new varieties of plants and animals hitherto undreamed of, and already have changed
              altogether our views of the problems of heredity. Instead of a vague mixture of all
              our ancestors, we possess definite characteristics of some of them only, though, like
              the blue Andalusian fowl, we may transmit to our children ancestral characters we do
              not ourselves exhibit. The family or race is more important in heredity than the
              individual parent. Thus the aristocratic theory of politics receives support from the
              experience of biology.</p>

                        <p>Simultaneously with the growth of geology, and the birth of the Darwinian hypothesis,
              a new development took place in physical science—the development of the conception of
              energy as a quantity invariable in amount throughout a series of physical changes. The
              genesis of the idea in its modern form may be traced in the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christiaan_Huygens">C. Huygens</name>
              (1629-1695), who applied it to the problems of pure dynamics. But, in the middle of
              the 19th century, by the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Prescott_Joule">James Prescott Joule</name>
              (1818-1889), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin">Lord
                Kelvin</name> (1824-1907), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermann_von_Helmholtz">H.L.F. von Helmholtz</name>
              (1821-1894), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs">J. Willard Gibbs</name>
              (1839-1903), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rudolf_Clausius">R.J.E. Clausius</name> (1822-1888) and others, it was extended to physical
              processes. The amount of heat produced by friction was found to bear a constant
              proportion to the work expended, and this experimental result led to the conception of
              an invariable quantity of something, to which the name of energy was given,
              manifesting itself in various forms such as heat or mechanical work. Energy thus took
              its place beside mass as a real quantity, conserved throughout a series of physical
              changes. Of late years, as we shall see below, evidence has appeared to show that mass
              is not absolutely constant, but may depend on the velocity when the velocity
              approaches that of light. Since the only essential quality of matter is its mass, this
              result seems to strike at the root of the metaphysical conception of matter as a real,
              invariable quantity. It remains to be seen whether the conception of energy as an
              invariable quantity will hold its place or give way to some similar modification as
              science develops. But, in the present state of knowledge, we may accept the principle
              of the conservation of energy as one of the most firmly established of physical
              laws.</p>
                        <p>The amount of energy in an isolated system remains invariable, but, if changes are
              going on in the system, the energy tends continually to become less and less available
              for the performance of useful work. All heat engines require a difference of
              temperature— a boiler and refrigerator, or their equivalents. We cannot continue to
              transform heat into mechanical work if all available objects are at a uniform
              temperature. But, if temperature differences exist, they tend to equalize themselves
              by irreversible processes of thermal conduction, and it becomes increasingly difficult
              to get useful work out of the supplies of heat. In an isolated system, then,
              equilibrium will be reached when this process of <q>"dissipation of energy"</q> is
              complete, and, from this single principle, the whole theory of the equilibrium of
              physical and chemical systems was worked out by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs">Willard Gibbs</name>. Such a
              method avoids altogether the use of atomic and molecular conceptions. In fact, some
              supporters of the theory of <q>"energetics"</q> expressly disclaim the conceptions of
              natural atoms and molecules as unnecessary and misleading, and prefer to found all
              science on the idea of energy. Matter, they argue, is known to us only as a vehicle
              for energy, and may itself be but a manifestation of that energy.</p>

                        <p>But the other great line of advance in recent physics, although it may lead us in the
              end to somewhat similar conclusions, has been traced by a method which used atomic and
              molecular conceptions in an extreme form. The passage of electricity through liquids
              had been explained by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</name> (1791-1867)
              and others as a transference of a succession of electric charges carried by <pb n="402" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0402.png"/> moving particles of matter or
              ions. At the end of the 19th century these ideas were extended, chiefly by the labours
              of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._J._Thomson">J.J.
                Thomson</name>, to elucidate also the conduction of electricity through gases. In
              1897 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._J._Thomson">Thomson</name> discovered that, in certain cases, the moving particles which
              carried the electric current were of much smaller mass than the smallest chemical
              atom, that of hydrogen, and that these minute particles, to which he gave the name of
              corpuscles, were identical from whatever substance they were obtained. They enter into
              the structure of all matter, and form a common constituent of all chemical atoms. The
              only known properties of these corpuscles are their mass and their electric charge.
              Now, a charged body when set in motion spreads electromagnetic energy into the
              surrounding medium. Thus, more force is needed to produce a given acceleration than if
              the body were uncharged. The body acts as though its mass were greater than when it is
              uncharged. Now there is reason to believe that the whole apparent mass of the minute
              corpuscles to which we have referred is an effect of their electric charge. The idea
              of a material particle thus disappears with that of material mass, and the corpuscle
              becomes an isolated unit of electricity— an electron. It is impossible to resist
              making the speculation that the whole of an atom is made up of electrons, and that
              mass is to be explained in terms of electricity, though it must be pointed out that
              there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>Another train of reasoning, starting from a different point, reinforces this result.
              The phenomena of the interference of beams of light in certain circumstances, to
              produce darkness or colour, indicate that light is some form of wave motion, and, to
              carry these waves, a hypothetical luminiferous aether was invented. The theoretical
              work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Clerk_Maxwell">J.
                Clerk Maxwell</name> (1831-1879) and the experiments of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Hertz">H.R. Hertz</name> (1857-1894)
              showed that the properties and velocity of propagation of light and of electromagnetic
              waves were identical and that their other properties differed only in degree. Thus
              light became an electromagnetic phenomenon. But light is started by some form of
              atomic vibration, and to start an electromagnetic wave requires a moving electric
              charge. Thus electric charges must exist within the atom, and we are led again to the
              theory of electrons by the road opened up by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hendrik_Lorentz">H.A. Lorentz</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Larmor">Joseph Larmor</name>.
              Such a theory suggests the occasional instability of the atom, and the phenomena of
              radioactivity, shown in a remarkable form by the substance radium, discovered by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Curie">M.</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marie_Curie">Mme. Curie</name>, have
              been explained satisfactorily by the theory of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Rutherford">E. Rutherford</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_Soddy">F. Soddy</name>, who
              regard the energy liberated as due to the disintegration of the atom. The evolutionary
              view of nature, established in the biological and sociological sciences, is thus
              extended to physical science, not only in the development of planets and suns, but
              even in the chemical atoms, hitherto believed indestructible and eternal.</p>

                        <p>As we have seen, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Francis Bacon</name> described a new method of discovery in which exclusive
              attention was paid to the collection and tabulation of facts, with a view to the
              detection of relations between them, and the consequent reference of <q>"effects"</q>
              to their proper <q>"causes."</q> Impressed by the barrenness of the a priori methods
              of the Schoolmen, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> in his philosophy went to the other extreme. The use of the Baconian
              method in its purity would be too laborious for success. Some guide is necessary in
              the collection of facts at an early stage of our investigations. Here the scientific
              imagination is brought into play, and some hypothesis is framed to explain the
              phenomena under investigation. The hypothesis may be suggested by the theories which
              are accepted at the time in cognate branches of knowledge, or it may be suggested by
              the few isolated facts already known or just discovered in the phenomena to be
              considered. From this new hypothesis, consequences are deduced by processes of logical
              reasoning—consequences which may be put to the test by comparison with the results of
              observation or experiment. If agreement is found, the hypothesis is, so far,
              confirmed, and gains in authority with every fresh concordance discovered. If the
              deductions from the hypothesis do not agree with the accepted interpretation of facts,
              the hypothesis may need modification, it may have to be abandoned altogether, or the
              want of concordance may point to some error or inconsistency in the fundamental
              concepts on which the hypothesis is based—the whole framework of that branch of
              science may need revision, as the idea of heat as a caloric substance had to be
              abandoned under the pressure of the experiments of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Prescott_Joule">Joule</name> on the
              equivalence between work done and heat developed. But the ultimate test of the
              validity of our knowledge can only be the consistency with each other of the parts of
              the whole scheme. If the received interpretation of one set of phenomena is not
              consistent with that of another, one or other or both of the interpretations must be
              wrong if we make the assumption necessary for all knowledge, namely, that the universe
              is intelligible to a mind capable of dealing with its complexity.</p>

                        <p>In early times, when the knowledge of nature was small, little attempt was made to
              divide science into parts, and men of science did not specialize. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> was a master of all
              science known in his day, and wrote indifferently treatises on physics or animals. As
              increasing knowledge made it impossible for any one man to grasp all scientific
              subjects, lines of division were drawn for convenience of study and of teaching.
              Besides the broad distinction into physical and biological science, minute
              subdivisions arose, and, at a certain stage of development, much attention was given
              to methods of classification, and much emphasis laid on the results, which were
              thought to have a significance beyond that of the mere convenience of mankind.</p>
                        <p>But we have reached the stage when the different streams of knowledge, followed by
              the different sciences, are coalescing, and the artificial barriers raised by calling
              those sciences by different names are breaking down. Geology uses the methods and data
              of physics, chemistry and biology; no one can say whether the science of radioactivity
              is to be classed as chemistry or physics, or whether sociology is properly grouped
              with biology or economics. Indeed, it is often just where this coalescence of two
              subjects occurs, when some connecting channel between them is opened suddenly, that
              the most striking advances in knowledge take place. The accumulated experience of one
              department of science, and the special methods which have been developed to deal with
              its problems, become suddenly available in the domain of another department, and many
              questions insoluble before may find answers in the new light cast upon them. Such
              considerations show us that science is in reality one, though we may agree to look on
              it now from one side and now from another as we approach it from the standpoint of
              physics, physiology or psychology.</p>

                        <p>Having traced the development of the most important of the fundamental conceptions of
              science, and followed the subdivision of natural knowledge into the various sections
              which for convenience mankind has made, let us now examine the meaning of the
              knowledge thus acquired, and its relation to other branches of learning.</p>
                        <p>By the slow and laborious methods of observation, hypothesis, deduction, and
              experimental verification, a scheme has been constructed which for the most part is
              consistent with itself, and bears the test of the comparison of one part with another.
              As a chart is drawn by the explorer of unknown seas to represent his discoveries in a
              conventional manner, so the scientific investigator constructs a mental model of the
              phenomena he observes, and tests its consistency with itself and its concordance with
              the results of further experiment. The chart does not give a lifelike picture of the
              coast as does a painting, but it represents one aspect of it conventionally in a
              manner best adapted for the immediate purpose. So the conceptions of one branch of
              science— mechanics let us say—represent the phenomena of nature in the conventional
              aspect best suited for one particular line of inquiry. It does not follow necessarily
              that <q>"nature"</q> in reality resembles the particular mental chart which mechanical
              science enables us to construct. It does not even follow that there is any
                <q>"reality"</q> underlying phenomena and corresponding with any of our conceptions.
              The whole problem which mankind has to face <pb n="403" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0403.png"/> undoubtedly includes an inquiry into
              the ultimate nature of reality. But that inquiry lies in the province of metaphysics,
              and is not necessarily involved in the pursuit of natural science. Metaphysics uses
              the results of natural science, as of all other branches of learning, as evidence
              bearing on her own deeper and more difficult questions. But it does not follow that
              natural science must solve metaphysical problems before being of use to man and
              enlarging the sphere of his knowledge. We need not ask whether the reality is
              represented accurately by our conventional model, whether indeed there be any reality
              at all, before using that model to introduce order into what would otherwise be mental
              confusion, and to enable us to make systematic and progressive use of natural
              resources. It is true that the possibility of constructing consistent schemes of
              scientific concepts is an argument in favour of the existence of a definite reality
              underlying phenomena resembling in some respects the pictures of it we draw. But
              metaphysicians are not agreed that it is a conclusive argument. The difficulty of
              making a scientific picture of the ultimate nature of reality may be illustrated by an
              example. Our first conception of a wooden stick involves the ideas of a certain
              long-shaped form, of smoothness, of hardness, of weight, of a certain brown colour,
              perhaps of some amount of elasticity. A microscope reveals a structure much more
              detailed than we imagined, and our mental model of the stick ceases to be smooth It
              becomes co-ordinated with those of a number of other bodies' which we know to be parts
              of trees, and study, as regards growth and structure, by the help of botany. From the
              results of observation and experiment, physics teaches us that the properties of the
              stick can only be represented satisfactorily by imagining that the substance of it is
              not infinitely divisible, that it consists of discontinuous particles or molecules.
              Again, chemistry assures us that the molecules of the stick are made up of still
              smaller parts or atoms, which separate from each other when, for instance, the stick
              is burned, and afterwards can arrange themselves into new molecules. When we pursue
              our inquiries into the nature of these atoms, we find that they can be resolved,
              partly at any rate, into much smaller particles or corpuscles in continual motion
              within the atom. These corpuscles themselves have been identified with isolated units
              of negative electricity or electrons, the vibrations of which within the atom sort out
              the electromagnetic radiation which falls on them and allow to reach our eyes those
              waves only which give us the sensation of brown colour. At present pioneers are
              attempting to explain electrons in terms of centres of elastic strain in a
              hypothetical aether. But we have travelled far from our original conception of the
              nature of the stick, and, should the problem last stated be solved, we should only
              find ourselves faced by the next one, the nature of the aether. But what constitutes
              reality? Where, in the endless chain of explanations discovered or to be discovered,
              can we stop and say: <q>"Here is the true picture of what the stick is"</q>? But this
              impossibility does not prevent us from getting the full use of each conception in turn
              when used for its particular purpose. To the schoolboy, the effective and deterrent
              conception of the stick is that of a hard, elastic, long-shaped solid. The botanist
              regards it as built up by the action of vegetable cells, which he refers to a
              particular kind of tree. To the chemist the stick is made up of atoms of carbon,
              hydrogen and oxygen, each with definite properties and arranged in certain
              combinations. The physicist sees these atoms composed of whirling electrons, each an
              ultimate electric unit not capable of further explanation, or possibly a centre of
              strain in an all-pervading aether of unknown nature. Each idea is useful in turn, and
              each corresponds truly with certain properties of the stick, corresponds with the
              stick itself in certain of its aspects.</p>
                        <p>Such considerations show us the meaning of the subdivisions into which science has
              been arranged for convenience of study and research. They represent different aspects
              of nature, different sections, as it were, cut through the solid model which stands
              for the sum of all our scientific knowledge of the universe.</p>
                        <p>A nerve-impulse may be regarded from a psychological aspect when we deal with the
              thought which accompanied it; from a physiological aspect when we examine its relation
              to other changes in the body. But modern methods have co-ordinated it also with
              definite chemical and electrical changes, and are said sometimes to have
                <q>"explained"</q> the nerve-impulse in physical terms.</p>
                        <p>But, as always, an <q>"explanation"</q> proves to be simply a restatement of a
              phenomenon in terms of other phenomena which previously are familiar to the mind, and
              therefore appear to be better understood. Nevertheless, from our present point of
              view, no one of these possible aspects of the phenomenon—of the nerve impulse— is
              essentially more fundamental than any other. To the psychologist the nerve-impulse is
              expressed in terms of thought, to the physicist by physical changes. The fact that a
              thought is accompanied by movement of matter or electricity does not make the thought
              less a fundamental conception.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps the best illustration is to be sought in the relation between the
              physical concepts of matter and electricity. As we have seen, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._J._Thomson">J.J. Thomson</name> discovered
              corpuscles which were common constituents of all matter, with masses smaller than
              those of any known atoms. One of these corpuscles represents a unit of negative
              electricity. An atom with a corpuscle in excess is an atom negatively electrified, an
              atom with one corpuscle less than the normal number is an atom positively electrified.
              In this scheme electricity is described in terms of matter. But these corpuscles have
              been identified with the hypothetical electrons of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hendrik_Lorentz">Lorentz</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Larmor">Larmor</name>, who
              consider matter to be composed of such isolated units of electricity. Such electrons,
              it has been shown, would possess mass by virtue of their electromagnetic properties.
              In this theory the idea of mechanical mass is eliminated altogether, and mass, and
              therefore matter, explained in terms of electricity. The view has been held by some
              that a mechanical explanation of a phenomenon is fundamental, and that a phenomenon so
              explained in terms of mechanical conceptions is fully understood. This idea may be
              traced to the familiarity with mechanical conceptions of our everyday experience. The
              mind obtains its concept of matter from the resistance which that matter manifests to
              forces tending to set it in motion when at rest, or to change its state of motion when
              travelling. This fundamental property of inertia is the measure of mass, and we reach
              the concept of mass by our muscular sense of the force needed to set mass in motion.
              Force seems to be a direct sense perception, though mathematically it is better to
              define force in terms of acceleration and mass—since mass is found normally to keep
              constant throughout a series of physical changes. The familiarity we feel, then, with
              the conception of matter is based on our familiarity with the conception of force. Our
              minds form this conception from their experience of a direct sense perception of
              muscular effort. This seems to be the basis of the whole feeling that mechanical
              conceptions are more fundamental than any others, and that, for instance, it is more
              intelligible to explain electricity in terms of mechanics than vice versa. But the
              fact that we have a special muscular sense is an accident of our bodies. It is
              possible that the electric fish, or torpedo, has a special electric sense, and that to
              such a fish-philosopher the perception of electromotive force is more real than that
              of mechanical force. Such a being might well argue that it is intelligible and
              satisfactory to explain the mysterious concept of mass, which he only reaches through
              the other equally mysterious concept of mechanical force, in terms of the familiar
              concept of electricity, well known to every torpedo from his direct sense perception
              of electromotive force. This instance may serve to show that it is quite as correct
              philosophically to explain matter in terms of electricity, as to explain electricity
              in terms of mass. The object of science is to find connexions between phenomena and
              thus to correlate them. At present a greater simplification may be reached by reducing
              all possible phenomena to mechanical conceptions than in any other way, but that only
              shows that the mechanical aspect of nature gives us a fuller view than any other at
              present known, not that mechanics is philosophically the most fundamental science.</p>

              one body carrying on international state intercourse without dominion over any
              territory at all. Thus, Great Britain has diplomatic relations, purely formal though

                            </cit> In France, where the state embraces a hierarchy of bodies and authorities
              culminating in the president of the republic, whose acts are the final form of a
              series of incomplete acts of the members of the hierarchy, it comes nearer to the
              theoretical meaning of the word. In Great Britain the sovereign power of the state is
              diffused among a number of authorities which have rights against each other and stand
              in independent relation towards the individual citizens. Actions can be brought by
              private citizens in the ordinary law courts against individual authorities, and there
              is no system of hierarchical responsibility which prevents a state official from being
              personally accountable for his administrative conduct. In <ref>

              continental system of entire subordination of the organs to the state as a whole, and
              the less logical British system is dwelt upon. <quote>"Few things," he observes, "are
                more instructive than the examination of the actions which have been brought in
                Great Britain against officers for retaining ships about to proceed to sea. Under
                  <title>the Merchant Shipping Act 1876</title> the board are open to detain any
                ship which, from its unsafe and unseaworthy condition, is a serious danger to human
                life."</quote>
                            <quote>"Most persons would suppose that the officials of the board of trade, so long
                as they—bona fide and without malice or corrupt motive—endeavour to carry out the
                provisions of the statute, would be safe from action at the hands of a shipowner.
                This, however, is not so. The board and its officers have more than once been sued
                with success. They have never been accused of either malice or negligence, but the
                mere fact that the board acts in an administrative capacity is not a protection to
                the board; nor is mere obedience to the orders of the board an answer to an action
                against its servants"</quote>

                        <p>In England, we may say, the notion of state, from the constitutional point of view,
              is still inchoate, but the play of international intercourse seems to be gradually
              leading to a clearer conception of the fact that an increasing national responsibility
              requires a corresponding increase in the power of co-ordinate state control. An
              instance of its absence is shown by the loose way in which the British Crown has
              granted governing powers to chartered companies (<ref>see RAID</ref>). This
              uncertainty applies as much to the United States as to Great Britain. In the Louisiana
              lynching riots, of which some Italian citizens were the victims, it was contended that
              the United States government was not responsible, and that the responsibility fell
              upon the government of Louisiana alone. This contention could not be pressed, and
              compensation was of course paid to Italy. Similar difficulties arose in connexion with
              the Japanese school question in California. The subject is well known to have raised
              apprehension as to the adequacy of the United States system to meet its centralized
              state responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>Another, and, in some respects, more dangerous feature of an inchoate conception of
              state responsibility is the growing apart, so to speak, of certain British
              dependencies. The British state, for international purposes, is the British Empire,
              for domestic purposes it is the United Kingdom. Any limb of the former's huge body can
              have interests different from those of the United Kingdom, and involve its
              responsibility. A significant step towards concentration of liability and control was
              taken by the Australian colonies in the federation brought about by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constitution_of_Australia">the Commonwealth Act of
                1900</title>. Under this act, by the way, an element of confusion has been created
              by the application of the term <q>"state"</q> to the federating colonies. <ref>Section
                6 of the act provides <quote>"the states"</quote> shall mean such of the colonies of

                Zealand, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, West Australia and South Australia as for

                colonies or territories as may be admitted into or established by the Commonwealth
                as states; and each of such parts of the Commonwealth shall be called <quote>"a
                  state."</quote>

                Commonwealth at its establishment."</quote> Following out this distinction between
              the Commonwealth and the states, articles 106 to 124 of the Commonwealth constitution
              deal with the respective positions of the Commonwealth, the original states, and the
              new states. <ref>Article 109 in particular provides that <quote>"when a law of a state
                  is inconsistent with the law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and
                  the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid,"</quote>
                            </ref> thus paving the way for the ultimate consolidation of the federal power.</p>

                            </foreign>, granting a special degree in the subject. In consequence of the great
              attention paid to the subject in Germany, her state policy has been largely the work
              of her political writers. The result has not unnaturally tended to a system bearing
              some resemblance to that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the American Union</name>, with this
              very important difference, however, that whereas in the United States the federal
              power is derived from the democratic forces of the individual states, in Germany it is
              derived from their aristocratic and absolutist forces. German political thinkers, in
              fact, have worked out <foreign xml:lang="de">
                                <hi rend="italic">Staatsrecht</hi>
                            </foreign> as a comparative study, in which arguments in favour of absolute government
              have received as much careful consideration as those in favour of democratic
              institutions, and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">the German state</name> has developed upon lines based on the best theoretical
              arguments of these thinkers. There is, therefore, no anomaly in its practically
              absolutist government working out the most democratic reforms as yet put into
              legislative form. It follows, however, that German theories are of little use in the
              consideration of the state problems with which British and American political thinkers
              have to deal. Anglo-Saxon institutions are following their independent development,
              and if the influence of foreign institutions is felt at all, it is probably that of
              the clear logical detail and cohesion of French institutions.</p>
